      <p><a href="https://ia601404.us.archive.org/28/items/idpolresponce_20200105/idpol%20responce.pdf">Today, several mods from brocialist subreddits published a 14-page piece, defending their stances against "idpol", placing the struggles of minorities second to class.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span> In it are several grave misunderstandings about Marxism and Leninism that truly tarnish our names to justify bigoted and reactionary perspectives. </p>

      <p>I usually just stay away from these sorts of dramas, but the reactionary elements really cannot be ignored anymore. </p>

      <p>But with this, I am really happy to see such a strong response rejecting this line and applying correct scientific ML analysis to this nonsense. I've picked a few lines from several users that I thought were really important to share and explain here. From their BS:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>the sole reason the blacks in USA are oppressed is because they are largely a proletariat. In usa they had a black president. Are the black bourgeoisie oppressed? No.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>"the blacks...." Wow... I am always reminded of this scene from "The Spook who sat by the door", where the leader of a black revolutionary liberation group basically said, no matter how successful we get, we will always be black to white capitalists: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qBJeJj64kk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qBJeJj64kk</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div>. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Well, peasants are not a revolutionary class by itself (this is why they should be led by the workers) because they own land, they own the means of production. They are petty bourgeoisie, they are by no means proletariat.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>

        <p>As we presented, the mass is by definition socially backwards. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>I cannot see how any self-respecting ML would disrespect the people in such a way to prove this disgusting point. They do not see how a capitalist environment fosters and promotes reactionary viewpoints onto the poor by exploiting their most basic materialistic conditions.  No ML should ever say such things about the masses. We fight for the people, not insult them to join us. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>There is no reason to address their specific problem in capitalism, because this would be detaching the individual out of the whole, and it would give the false narrative that racism, an idea, is what oppresses the particular group... </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Jfc, are they seriously trying to say racism does not need to be addressed because all they need to do is to just overthrow capitalism to cure it? Also, are they saying racism is a <em>freaking facade</em>??? How dense does someone have to be to see that these are real struggles that all socialists should acknowledge and stand against? How dare they dilute these struggles to "oh it's just capitalism." I am sure the black panthers would join them in their fight to overthrow capitalism with such analysis /s. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hai2viOKyBk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=46">Oh wait, no they won't</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div>. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Someone didn't read Marx closely enough: the proletariat only becomes the proletariat once the working class understands ITSELF as the working class, the agent of revolutionary process in capitalist society, and moves to assert its class interest. The working class needs to SELF-IDENTIFY as the working class. Basic Marx.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Also, they had the audacity (but not surprisingly) to misgender them and respond with homophobic statements:  </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Sorry, i know no one is offended by this. If they are, then i ask forgiveness for this grave crime.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>and </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Seems like someone is b*tthurt by our stances. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>These are not comrades. They are far from it. Many leftist subs have already banned these mods for their heinous stances already, and we should warn all comrades to stay away from these reactionary spaces. </p>

      <p>Lastly, they dedicated an entire section on me. I do not take offense, nor I did not want to draw attention to it. However, there is one thing I do want to point out from it. They called me an "enemy" for stating the following:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>As a Leninist, thank you for making this post. It's absolutely appalling that they would downplay minority struggles like this, especially with LBGTQ+ comrades. We should all stand directly in opposition to these sorts of platforms. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/9o0oar/identity_and_socialism/">The mods and r/socialism have made it very clear on where we stand here.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[8]" title="press 8 to open link"></span> "</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>I stand by this statement 100%. If this makes me an enemy, so be it. But don't call yourself comrades or MLs, as we would never stand for the bigotry, revisionism, lies, and reactionary elements of these imposters. </p>

      <p>TLDR: Beware of brocialist transphobic propaganda and enablers. They are not our allies or comrades. Leninists should harshly denounce these statements.</p>
