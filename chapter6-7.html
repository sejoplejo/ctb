      <p><strong>Transformation Problem Discussion Post</strong></p>

      <p>In this post I will discuss what the "Transformation Problem" is, why it is important, and a few 
solutions/responses to it. I also want this to be a discussion thread, so ask any questions you'd 
like, object to anything I wrote, etc. </p>

      <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

      <p>I will actually start with why the Transformation Problem is important, before saying what it is. 
This will give you some motivation to learn more about it, and will tell you why you should keep 
reading this post, if it gets boring or confusing. </p>

      <p>It is very important to understand the Transformation Problem because it alone, especially among 
academics, is the single most common reason Marx's value theory is rejected. It is argued that 
Marx's own solution to this problem fails because it is inconsistent. It is also argued that the 
problem <em>cannot</em> be solved in a way that is consistent with other central claims of Marx's 
theory. It is therefore incumbent upon all Marxists to understand and take a position on this 
issue.</p>

      <p>Marx's value theory is the basis of scientific socialism as opposed to utopian socialism.
You don't need any scientific theory to feel moral outrage at the consequences of capitalism. Socialists were doing that long before Marx and concocting morally ideal societies in response. But they didn't have an adequate scientific theory that explained why capitalism produces those consequences and its place in the historical development of society. The distinction between utopian and scientific socialism is analogous to pre-scientific and scientific medicine. Before the advent of scientific medicine, people's methods of removing ailments were ineffective. Similarly, successfully moving past capitalism requires understanding capitalism and such an understanding is provided by Marx. If Marx's critics are right, then his failure to solve the transformation problem crumbles the foundation of scientific socialism.</p>

      <p><strong>What (and What Not!)</strong></p>

      <p>A <em>key</em> insight into understanding the Transformation Problem is understanding what it is <em>not</em>. 
The fuller name for the problem comes from the title of chapter 9 of <a href="http://digamo.free.fr/penguin3.pdf"><em>Capital, Vol. 3</em></a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span>, The Transformation of Commodity Values into Prices of 
Production. The follwing is <em>extremely</em> important: <em>The Transformation Problem, the problem of 
transforming values into prices of production, is not the problem of transforming one kind of 
thing, abstract labor or its duration measured in labor-time (e.g. hours), into another kind of 
thing, money measured in the money commodity (e.g. ounces of gold or bills signifying gold).</em> The 
move from labor-time units to money units is given by the "monetary expression of labor time" or 
MELT and has nothing directly to do with the Transformation Problem. In an economy with a money 
commodity, the MELT is simply a unit of money commodity divided by the average labor time 
required to produce it. (I won't address the case of economies without a money commodity. We can 
discuss this in the comments if you'd like.) For example, if it takes on average 1 hour to 
produce 1 ounce of gold, then the MELT is 1 ounce of gold per hour. If a dollar bill signifies an 
ounce of gold, then the MELT is $1/hr. The average hour of productive labor then creates $1 of 
value. This allows you to convert back and forth between labor time and money. </p>

      <p>The Transformation Problem is not a problem of transforming units of measurement, of going from 
labor-time to money. If you thought this, and it is a very common misunderstanding, you have 
fundamentally misunderstood Marx's value theory. I will go so far as to say that understanding 
why this is wrong will help clarify the entirety of Marx's value theory.
Prices of production are simply prices which bring the capitalist the average rate of profit. 
Marx's Transformation Problem is the same problem on which Smith, Ricardo, and all classical 
political economy floundered: How is the existence of a general rate of profit consistent with 
the law of (surplus) value, the determination of value by labour-time? In <em>Theories of Surplus 
Value</em> Marx is clear that this is the central problem that he needs to solve:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch03.htm#s5">The seven times greater profit in the one manufactory as compared with the other - or in 
general the law of profit, that it is in proportion to the magnitude of the capital advanced - 
thus prima facie contradicts the law of surplus-value or of profit (since Adam Smith treats the 
two as identical) that it consists purely of the unpaid surplus-labour of the workmen. Adam Smith 
puts this down with quite naïve thoughtlessness, without the faintest suspicion of the 
contradiction it presents. All his disciples - since none of them considers surplus-value in 
general, as distinct from its determinate forms - followed him faithfully in this. With Ricardo, 
as already noted, it merely comes out even more strikingly.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span> [...]</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch10.htm#sa4">Instead of postulating this general rate of profit, Ricardo should rather have examined in how 
far its existence is in fact consistent with the determination of value by labour-time, and he 
would have found that instead of being consistent with it, prima facie, it contradicts it, and 
that its existence would therefore have to be explained through a number of intermediary stages, 
a procedure which is very different from merely including it under the law of value.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>In the transformation of values into prices of production, the transformation is one of mere 
<em>magnitude</em>, not <em>substance</em>. Marx is clear about this:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Price, after all, is the value of the commodity as distinct from its use-value (and this is also 
the case with market price, <em>whose distinction from value is not qualitative, but merely 
quantitative, bearing exclusively on the magnitude of value</em>). A price that is <em>qualitatively 
distinct</em> from value is an absurd contradiction. (<em>Capital, Vol. 3</em> 476, my emphasis)</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This is why Marx calls prices of production <em>transformed forms of value</em> and profits <em>transformed 
forms of surplus value</em> (e.g., <em>Capital, Vol. 3</em>, pp. 263, 267, 274). They are "made" of the same 
"stuff". The Transformation Problem is the problem of transforming prices which are equal to 
values into prices which bring the average rate of profit and are therefore not equal to values. 
This is a merely quantitative, not qualitative, transformation.</p>

      <p><strong>Marx's Solution</strong></p>

      <p>Marx presents his solution to the Transformation Problem in chapter 9 of <em>Capital, Vol. 3</em>. 
Remember, the problem is how a general rate of profit can be consistent with the law of value 
since the existence of a general rate of profit entails that the profits a capital receives are 
unrelated to the surplus value that that capital produces; similarly, the price of that capital's 
commodity is unrelated to the amount of labor required for its production. 
Marx's solution is that the total amount of value and surplus value in the economy is determined 
by labor-time and that individual profits are mere portions of this total surplus value. Here we 
see the source of Marx's two famous "aggregate equalities": total prices of production = total 
value and total profits = total surplus value. </p>

      <p>Now we can better understand why Marx says prices of production are "transformed forms" of values 
(and profits are "transformed forms" of surplus value): they are qualitatively identical ("made 
of the same stuff"), and differ only quantitatively, only in magnitude. Let's illustrate this 
with a simple example. Let's say that some capital's cost-price is c=$80 and v=$20 and that the 
rate of surplus value is %100. The value of this capital's commodity is then c+v+s=$80+$20+$20=
$120 (where c=constant capital, v=variable capital, and s=surplus value). If the average profit 
rate is %10, then the price of production of this capital's commodity is c+v+p=$80+$20+$10=$110. </p>

      <p>The difference between this commodity's value and price of production is merely quantitative. 
When the commodity sells at its value, the capitalist receives back as profit the same amount of 
surplus value that his own workers produced. When the commodity sells at its price of production, 
which is here less than its value, the capitalist receives back as profit a smaller amount of 
surplus value than his own workers produced. What happens to the surplus value this capitalist's 
workers produced but the capitalist didn't receive as profit, the $10 difference between value 
and price of production? It is received by a different capitalist who sells his commodity at a 
price of production <em>greater</em> than its value, and so whose profit is <em>greater</em> than the amount of 
surplus value actually produced by his own workers. </p>

      <p>Since the amount of aggregate profit is equal to the amount of aggregate surplus value, these 
individual deviations of price of production from value cancel each other out. The total surplus 
value, which is completely determined by surplus labor, is simply <em>redistributed</em> so that each 
capitalist receives an amount of surplus value determined by the average rate of profit, rather 
than the actual amount of surplus value his own workers produced. This cancelling out of the 
deviations can be seen in Marx's tables in chapter 9. An easier to read table was made by Rubin, 
which I've slightly altered <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wRrqQcl.png" class="hoverZoomLink">here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button image collapsed" title="" data-host="imgur"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="imgur"></div>. You can see how the same 
amount of surplus value that goes unreceived by capitals of less-than-average organic composition 
(c/v) is received by capitals of greater-than-average organic composition. </p>

      <p>Value is still determined by labor-time and surplus value is still determined by surplus labor, 
so Marx has shown that a general rate of profit is consistent with the law of value, an 
achievement made by no political economist before him.</p>

      <p><strong>An Inconsistent Solution?</strong></p>

      <p>The prices of commodities have been quantitatively transformed from those that give the 
capitalist a profit equal to the surplus value his workers produced to those that give him a 
profit determined by the average rate. But under capitalism the inputs which make up c and v, the 
means of production and labor-power, are themselves commodities (although labor-power is not 
directly produced by any capital). The capitalist buys them at <em>their</em> prices of production, not 
their values. The accusation of inconsistency arises here. It is alleged that when Marx 
transforms the value of a commodity into its price of production, he forgets to similarly 
transform the <em>inputs</em> into that same commodity. In most discussions of the Transformation 
Problem, you will encounter a sentence like "Marx forgot to transform the inputs". That's what 
they mean.</p>

      <p>It is further alleged either that a consistent solution is impossible or if there is one that 
<em>one</em> of Marx's two aggregate equalities must be wrong. Which one is wrong and which is right is 
completely arbitrary, simply imposed by the author as an assumption.</p>

      <p><strong>Single-System Interpretations</strong></p>

      <p>The position I favor claims that Marx's solution was right and needs no correcting. According to 
this position, called the "single-system interpretation," Marx does not need to transform the 
price of the inputs. Why?</p>

      <p>For Marx, this is the circuit of capital: M -&gt; C [mp + lp] ... P ... C' -&gt; M'</p>

      <p>The capitalist begins with a sum of money, M. He uses this money to buy commodities C consisting 
of means of production (mp) and labor power (lp). The arrows signify <em>exchange</em>. These 
commodities enter the production process, P. At the end of this production process a new 
commodity is produced, C', whose value is greater than C. This commodity is sold for a sum of 
money, M', which is greater than the sum originally advanced, M. Notice that the circuit begins 
not with means of production and labor power but with a sum of money, M. This sum of money is the 
real and necessary input to the production process, without which the process cannot begin. Under 
Marx's early assumption that commodities exchange at their values, the value of this sum of money 
and the value of C [mp + lp] are the same. When this assumption is dropped, the value of this sum 
of money and the value of C [mp + lp] are not the same. This is the <em>key</em> point: <em>A sum of money 
has no price of production or any other price differing from its value</em>. (This is not to say that 
it is impossible for someone to, say, sell $100 for $105, but this properly belongs under the 
investigation of <em>interest</em>. See chapters 21-4 of <em>Capital, Vol. 3</em>.)</p>

      <p>The value of this initial sum of money, M, consisting of the constant and variable capital needed 
to buy means of production and labor power, need not and <em>cannot</em> be transformed into a price of 
production.</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch10.htm#sa4b">The price of
the commodity which serves as a measure of value and hence as
money, does not exist at all, because otherwise, apart from the
commodity which serves as money I would need a second
commodity to serve as money - a double measure of values.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5]" title="press 5 to open link"></span></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The circuit of capital for the money commodity differs from that given above. It is instead: 
<a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1885-c2/ch01.htm#3">M -&gt; C [mp + lp] ... P ... M' (*Capital, Vol. 2, p. 131)</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>Notice the absence of C'. Say the money commodity is gold. The circuit of capital for gold 
production starts with gold and ends with a larger sum of gold. This newly produced gold is 
already money, so it doesn't have to be exchanged. Hence no need for C'-&gt;M' in this circuit. The 
surplus value created by gold producers does not have to be realized in circulation like all 
other surplus value. The profit received in the gold industry is always equal to the surplus 
value produced in the gold industry. Hence the gold industry does not participate in the 
redistribution of surplus value among industries.</p>

      <p>The inputs, the initial constant and variable capital needed to buy means of production and labor 
power, therefore require no transformation. The value of constant and variable capital is the 
value of this sum of money, <em>not</em> the value of the means of production and labor power that it 
buys. As Marx wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch24.htm">The £50 of constant capital means nothing more
than that it contains the same amount of labour-time as that embodied in £50
of gold.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[7]" title="press 7 to open link"></span></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

      <p>This post is already too long, so I won't get into other interpretations or objections to 
single-system interpretations here. We can discuss all of this in the comments if you want. I 
hope I have given you some understanding of what the Transformation Problem is and why it is 
important. </p>
