      <p>Recently there was some controversy regarding my claim that China remains a Socialist and Marxist-Leninist state. I responded in the comment section, but it was pointed out by <a href="/u/smokeuptheweed9">/u/smokeuptheweed9</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span><span class="RESUserTag" res-prevent-cloning-1584232177669="">
				<a class="userTagLink RESUserTagImage truncateTag" title="set a tag" href="javascript:void 0"> </a>
			</span> that I should combine the scattered comments into a single post. So here it is, with a small amount of added commentary at the beginning.</p>

      <ul>

        <li>China's primary contradiction was <em>not</em> proletariat vs bourgoisie, it was how to build socialism with underdeveloped productive forces. The answer was inspired by Lenin's NEP: a form of market-socialism, controlled by the Communist Party of China. The goal is to modernize the productive forces, to enable the building of higher stage Socialism. This is <em>not</em> a "betrayal" of Socialism or Mao. Far from it, in fact. The economic progress in China has been hailed as "miraculous" around the globe, as it is the <em>fastest growing economy in the history of human civilization</em>.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Furthermore, there has been some confusion regarding a Monthly Review article and term "privatization" as is used in China. All land in China is owned by the state. All of it. It can only be leased, but never purchased outright. It is 100% publicly owned. Additionally, <em>"While the so-called ‘privatization’ process of allows some private ownership, whether domestic or foreign...this is a far cry from real privatization, as occurs in the United States and other capitalist countries. The state, headed by the CCP, retains a majority stake in the company and guides the company’s path".</em> </p>

      <p>Moreover, China <em>appoints</em> top management, and can fire them. This is nothing like "Capitalism". This is a Marxist-Leninist tool ("socialist market economy") with the purpose of <em>modernizing the productive forces</em> with the goal of <em>building</em> Socialism, <em>not betraying it</em> as many confused Leftists have wrongly claimed.</p>

      <p>A further rebuttal on the confusion about "privatization" in China:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p><em>"Examining what companies are truly private is important because privatization is often confused with the spreading out of shareholding and the sale of minority stakes. In China, 100 percent state ownership is often diluted by the division of ownership into shares, some of which are made available to nonstate actors, such as foreign companies or other private investors. Nearly two-thirds of the state-owned enterprises and subsidiaries in China have undertaken such changes, leading some foreign observers to relabel these firms as “nonstate” or even “private.” But this reclassification is incorrect. The sale of stock does nothing by itself to alter state control: dozens of enterprises are no less state controlled simply because they are listed on foreign stock exchanges. As a practical matter, three-quarters of the roughly 1,500 companies listed as domestic stocks are still state owned."</em></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>To put China's economy into perspective, allow me to quote you the following:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>If the US government nationalised the 1000 largest manufacturing companies, they would have approximately the same control over the American economy as the Chinese state has over the Chinese economy. If in addition, the US state owned all the biggest banks and financial institutions (and almost only lent money to state companies), and a large slice of the service and building industries, not to mention all the land which farmers till, and introduced a five-year plan, almost nobody would deny that a planned economy had been introduced in the USA.</p>

      <p><strong>Part 1 of 5</strong></p>

      <p>Okay, here we go. I had to find many of the sources I've read in the past, and it took a while to find them. I couldn't find all of them, but the ones I could find are just as good and provide a very strong case for my stance that China remains a Socialist country, and a Marxist-Leninist state, albeit <em>possibly</em> with some revisionism, though nowhere near as much as many think (even the USSR was revisionist at certain points, but I would think nobody would deny that the USSR was a Marxist-Leninist Socialist state despite their revisionism). I will be providing lots of large excerpts from various sources, because in most cases they say it just as good or much better than I could:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>In the mid-1930s, China was being rent asunder by four competing sides. One was the communist Red Army, headed by Mao Zedong. Another group was the Japanese fascists and their Imperial Army. A third was the Guomindang Nationalists, abbreviated “KMT” in English and ruled by Chiang Kai-Shek...Things were not going as planned for the Western empire. They were backing, hell or high water, Chiang Kai-Shek [referred to as "Peanut" or "Generalissimo" by the West]</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Americans privately understood that the very corrupt, dissipated Generalissimo and his KMT did not stand a chance against Mao and formidable Reds..."Red Star over China" became an international bestseller that year. Much to their shock...Everywhere the communists took control, opium addiction, gambling, organised crime, prostitution, feet binding, child slavery, homelessness, illiteracy and starvation were eradicated. Red Army soldiers and citizens were smiling, industrious, positive, well-fed and committed to the cause. It was clearly not propaganda and all manifestly real.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>..</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The West was caught in a philosophical, transitive loop. Mao and the Reds are communist, communism is evil, therefore everything that Mao and the Reds do must be bad. And that was the rub, this massive cognitive dissonance: they’re communists, so how can it be working so well for them?</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>..</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Unable to come to terms with their blind ideology, FDR, Washington and the popular press simply could not bring themselves to say “communists”, so Mao and Co. were dubbed “the so-called communists”....British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Roosevelt [were told] that the Chinese were “radishes”, red on the outside, but white below the surface – not realcommunists...Thus, the square peg of CPC reality was crammed into the round hole of Western denial.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>This same kind of rigid, anticommunist ideology is still going strong in the West, as it tries, mostly badly and incorrectly, to understand the Chinese people’s sociocultural evolution and Baba Beijing’s (the leadership) politico-economic management of the country. To Western mass media, politicians, movers and shakers, China is still “so-called communist”. It must be capitalist, to be doing so well, right? Just as FDR and his generation were blinded by propaganda, today’s Eurangloland and much of the rest of the world are still brainwashed. Evidence is beating Westerners over the head, if they could just take their zealous blinkers off.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Let’s start with China’s national People’s Constitution and Deng Xiaoping. Anticommunists love to fawn over Deng, like he was some kind of crusading capitalist guru. Yet, it was he who presided over the most recent rewriting of the national constitution, in 1982.¹ China’s constitution is a powerful rebuke of capitalism and everything the West stands for.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Chinese constitution proudly splashes the term “communism” or “communist” fifteen times, “socialism” and “socialist” a whopping 123 times. Dialectical terms like “class”, “struggle”, “mass”, “independence”, “labour”, “worker/working”, “peasant”, “exploitation”, “capitalism”, “ownership”, “proletariat”, “collective”, “cooperate”, “private”, “fight”, “struggle”, (democratic) “dictatorship”, “power” and “feudal” are spelled out a total of 265 times. “Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought” are cited ten times and “revolution” twelve times.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Big government, central planning vocabulary, such as “safeguard”, “protect”, “lead”, “reform”, “rural”, “urban”, “production”, “plan”, “economy”, “system”, “administration”, “rules”, “regulations”, “institution”, “enterprise”, “science”, “technology”, “modern”, “organisation”, “manage”, “progress”, “agriculture”, “farm”, “land”, “industry”, “resources”, “education”, “central” and “develop” get cited a mind boggling 703 times.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The importance of the central government guiding the people to what is now being dubbed the Chinese Dream, is expressed by the words “state” and “government” being used 292 times.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Defiant words aimed at standing up to and defeating the West, like “hegemony”, “imperialism”, “colonialism”, “combat”, “defend”, “army”, “military”, “security”, “aggression”, “fight”, “sabotage” and “provocation” are flung like weapons a total of 85 times.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Any doubts about who is the beneficiary of China’s constitution are dispelled by “public” being used 143 times and “people”, a mind blowing 392 times, Western elitism be damned.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <ul>

          <li><strong><em>Property market bubbles?</em></strong> What property? Private property, for sure, but it’s not real property. All real estate is 100% owned by the people of China. There is not one square metre of private land in the People’s Republic. You can pay for up to a 70-year usage lease on a piece of land and develop it, but no one can buy the dirt.</li>

        </ul>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <ul>

          <li><strong><em>Private enterprise?</em></strong> It is thriving for sure, but is heavily concentrated in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), that complement and do not seriously compete with the state sectors of the economy. The private sector is especially the many millions of mom and pop and solo businesses that blanket the country.</li>

        </ul>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <ul>

          <li><strong><em>Free markets?</em></strong> There [are virtually no] private banks in China. They are all people powered. The world’s largest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is state owned of course, as well as three other global Top Ten banks: #1 (ICBC), #5 China Construction Bank (CCB), #9 Bank of China (BOC) and #10 Agricultural Bank of China (ABC).³ Ditto all insurance companies, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock and precious metals markets. Same goes for all major media outlets, especially television, radio and print media, although everyone has heard about Beijing being the new “Hollywood of the East”, which is mostly private sector.</li>

        </ul>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <ul>

          <li><strong><em>Unfettered capitalism?</em></strong> Get outta here! Almost all major economic sectors in China are dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Everything from airlines/avionics to aerospace to chemical industries, from construction to maritime shipping to mining, from nuclear energy to petroleum to railways, from steel to telecommunications to utilities, over 100 key sectors have a huge, people-powered footprint. Many are some of the world’s biggest corporations.</li>

        </ul>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <ul>

          <li><strong><em>Privatisation?</em></strong> You have to look beyond the deceptive headlines. Baba Beijing caps the sale of SOE stock to the public, at 30%. Furthermore, there are strict controls on making sure someone doesn’t try to control what’s offered. The ownership of the shares has to be spread out. Most of these stocks are owned by Chinese citizens (A shares), but some are on offer to foreigners (B shares). Interestingly, more and more Chinese companies, including SOEs, are doing IPOs in Western stock markets, as part of their 30%.</li>

        </ul>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <ul>

          <li><strong><em>Reforms?</em></strong> Ha-ha-ha, the joke’s on you! Baba Beijing will never sell off the people’s SOEs. It knows that the citizens’ social harmony and economic stability are rooted in its ability to macro-manage and long term (Five-Year) plan the country’s direction, via the 100% ownership of all the real estate (Marxism’s controlling the means of production), as well as the key industries and sectors. The CPC will continue to create wealth, under the rubric of socialism with Chinese characteristics, by borrowing some capitalist trappings. But it is only transitional. Deng Xiaoping said it many times and it continues going unheard in the West, that the goal is to follow the Marxist economic path to a wealthy communist society.</li>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Ever since the Peoples' Republic of China invited foreign capital into the country and behind the "Bamboo Curtain", China has been dismissed by most Left observers as selling out to capitalism and class society, with all its associated evils.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Of course capitalist commentators and "expert" economists gloat over the Chinese renunciation of socialist principles and their craven debt to neo-liberal market economics. "Proof that socialism is dead", they say.
But China's rapid and successful response to the capitalist Global Financial Crisis (GFC) has obliged a serious rethink of such knee-jerk assessments. Clearly China has, against all the doomsayers' predictions, survived a crisis within which their neo-liberal "betters" in Europe and the USA are drowning, and the economic miracle continues. Maybe the "Chinese Economic Miracle" is not as capitalist as most westerners think.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Upon his death in 1976, Mao's dream of China's Great Leap had not been realised, despite several attempts. After his death, a profound ideological struggle took place in the Party, between those on the "Hard Left" (led by the so called Gang of Four) who placed primary stress on a politically driven Chinese road to socialism, and the "Moderates" who were deeply materialist and favoured "Expertness" over "Redness".</p>

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Deng Xiaoping and his faction had to address the deeper Marxist problem: that the transition from a rural/peasant political economy to modern industrial socialism was difficult, if not impossible, without the intervening stage of industrial capitalism.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Deng had always maintained that the Party's reforms were a specifically Chinese road to socialism, and subsequent leaderships have echoed the same position. On closer examination, they may well have been correct.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p><strong>At no stage over the past 30 years has the State relinquished control of the "commanding heights" or "levers" of the Chinese economy</strong>: </p>

          <li>

            <p>Second, market socialism in China is a Marxist-Leninist tool that is important to socialist construction.</p>

          </li>

          <li>

            <p>Third, the Chinese Communist Party’s continued leadership and control of China’s market economy is central to Chinese socialism.</p>

          </li>

          <li>

            <p>Fourth, Chinese socialism has catapulted a workers state to previously unknown economic heights.</p>

          </li>

          <li>

            <p>Fifth, the successful elevation of China as a modern industrial economy has laid the basis for ‘higher’ forms of socialist economic organization.</p>

          </li>

          <li>

            <p>And sixth, China applies market socialism to its relations with the Third World and plays a major role in the fight against imperialism.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Chinese revolution in 1949 was a tremendous achievement for the international communist movement...Despite the vast social benefits brought about by the revolution, China’s productive forces remained grossly underdeveloped and left the country vulnerable to famines and other natural disasters. Uneven development persisted between the countryside and the cities, and the Sino-Soviet split cut China off from the rest of the socialist bloc. These serious obstacles led the CCP, with Deng Xiaoping at the helm, to identify China’s underdeveloped productive forces as the primary contradiction facing socialist construction.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p><strong><em>Unlike industrialized Western countries, the primary contradiction facing China was not between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie</em></strong>–the proletariat and its party had already overthrown the bourgeoisie in the 1949 revolution–<strong><em>but rather between China’s enormous population and its underdeveloped productive forces.</em></strong> While well-intended and ambitious, campaigns like the Great Leap Forward would continue to fall short of raising the Chinese masses out of poverty without revolutionizing the country’s productive forces.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>From this contradiction, Deng proposed a policy of “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” or market socialism.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>After Mao’s death in 1976 and the end of the Cultural Revolution a year later, the CCP ,under the leadership of <strong><em>Chairman Deng Xiaoping, launched an aggressive campaign of modernizing the underdeveloped productive forces in China. Known as the four modernizations</em></strong>–economic, agricultural, scientific &amp; technological, and defensive–the CCP began experimenting with models for achieving these revolutionary changes.</p>

        <p>[T]he CCP understood that building lasting socialism required a modernized industrial base. Without such a base, the Chinese masses would continue to live at the mercy of natural disasters and imperialist manipulation.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Deng outlined this goal in an October 1978 speech before the Ninth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions:</p>

        <p><em>"The Central Committee points out that this is a great revolution in which China’s economic and technological backwardness will be overcome and the dictatorship of the proletariat further consolidated."</em></p>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Since the implementation of market socialism, China has experienced unprecedented economic expansion, growing faster than every other economy in the world. Deng’s market socialism decisively lifted the Chinese masses out of systemic poverty and established the country as an economic giant whose power arguably exceeds the largest imperialist economies of the West.</p>

        <p>"<em>The New Economic Policy introduces a number of important changes in the position of the proletariat and, consequently, in that of the trade unions. The great bulk of the means of production in industry and the transport system remains in the hands of the proletarian state. This, together with the nationalisation of the land, shows that the New Economic Policy does not change the nature of the workers’ state, although it does substantially alter the methods and forms of socialist development for it permits of economic rivalry between socialism, which is now being built, and capitalism, which is trying to revive by supplying the needs of the vast masses of the peasantry through the medium of the market.

        <p>Recall that Deng argued that market socialism was essential to modernizing China’s productive forces and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin would have agreed wholeheartedly with Deng’s assessment, as articulated in an April 1921 article entitled “The Tax in Kind.” Lenin writes:</p>

        <p><em>"Socialism is inconceivable without large-scale capitalist engineering based on the latest discoveries of modern science. It is inconceivable without planned state organisation which keeps tens of millions of people to the strictest observance of a unified standard in production and distribution.

      <p>Part 4 of 5</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The so-called ‘privatization’ of small and medium-sized state industries in the mid-1990s and early 2000’s provoked an outcry from Western ‘leftists’, claiming that this represented the final victory of capitalism in China. But since ‘left’ groups are so often subject to bickering over obscure definitions and irrelevant (but no less verbose!) debates about distant historical questions, let’s see what the capitalists themselves have to say about ‘privatization’ in China. In a May 2009, Derrick Scissors of the Heritage Foundation lays the issue to rest in an article called “Liberalization in Reverse.” He writes:</p>

        <p><em>"Examining what companies are truly private is important because privatization is often confused with the spreading out of shareholding and the sale of minority stakes. In China, 100 percent state ownership is often diluted by the division of ownership into shares, some of which are made available to nonstate actors, such as foreign companies or other private investors. Nearly two-thirds of the state-owned enterprises and subsidiaries in China have undertaken such changes, leading some foreign observers to relabel these firms as “nonstate” or even “private.” But this reclassification is incorrect. The sale of stock does nothing by itself to alter state control: dozens of enterprises are no less state controlled simply because they are listed on foreign stock exchanges. As a practical matter, three-quarters of the roughly 1,500 companies listed as domestic stocks are still state owned."</em></p>

        <p><strong><em>While the so-called ‘privatization’ process of allows some private ownership, whether domestic or foreign, Scissors makes clear that this is a far cry from real privatization, as occurs in the United States and other capitalist countries. The state, headed by the CCP, retains a majority stake in the company and guides the company’s path.</em></strong></p>

        <p><strong>No capitalist country in the history of the world has ever had state control over all of these industries.</strong> In countries like the United States or France, certain industries like railroads and health insurance may have state ownership, but it falls drastically short of dominating the industry. The importance of this widespread state ownership is that the essential aspects of the Chinese economy are run by the state headed by a party whose orientation is towards the working class and peasantry.</p>

        <p>Particularly damaging to the China-as-state-capitalist argument is the status of banks and the Chinese financial system. Scissors elaborates:</p>

        <p><em>"the state exercises control over most of the rest of the economy through the financial system, especially the banks. By the end of 2008, outstanding loans amounted to almost $5 trillion, and annual loan growth was almost 19 percent and accelerating; lending, in other words, is probably China’s principal economic force. The Chinese state owns all the large financial institutions, the People’s Bank of China assigns them loan quotas every year, and lending is directed according to the state’s priorities"</em></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>(CIS) published a July 2008 article that says that those who think that China is becoming a capitalist country “misunderstand the structure of the Chinese economy, which largely remains a state-dominated system rather than a free-market one.” (9) The article elaborates:</p>

        <p><em>"By strategically controlling economic resources and remaining the primary dispenser of economic opportunity and success in Chinese society, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is building institutions and supporters that seem to be entrenching the Party’s monopoly on power. Indeed, in many ways, reforms and the country’s economic growth have actually enhanced the CCP’s ability to remain in power. Rather than being swept away by change, the CCP is in many ways its agent and beneficiary."</em></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>While the CIS [The capitalist Australia-based Center for Independent Studies] goes on to cry crocodile tears about the lack of economic and political freedoms in China, Marxist-Leninists read between the lines and know the truth: China isn’t capitalist, the CCP isn’t pursuing capitalist development, and market socialism has succeeded in laying the material foundation for ‘higher socialism’.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The market is not a mode of production; rather, the market is a form of economic organization. Deng explains this distinction well in a lecture series he gave in 1992. He states:</p>

        <p>"<em>The proportion of planning to market forces is not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism. A planned economy is not equivalent to socialism, because there is planning under capitalism too; a market economy is not capitalism, because there are markets under socialism too. Planning and market forces are both means of controlling economic activity.</em>" [Incidentally, Marxist economists agree with this, as do many non-Marxist economists]</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Though bourgeois news sources decry China’s economic relationship with Africa as ‘imperialist’, this is a reflection of the Western trade mentality that cannot understand any economic relations in terms other than ruthless exploitation. Premier Wen Jiabao said at a 2006 summit in Cairo that Chinese-African trade relations are designed to “help African countries develop by themselves and offer training for African professionals.”  The focus of the summit, according to Wen, is “reducing and remitting debts, economic assistance, personnel training and investment by enterprises.”  Wen continues:</p>

        <p><em>"On the political front, China will not interfere in internal affairs of African countries. We believe that African countries have the right and capability to solve their own problems.”</em></p>

        <p>This is not the attitude of imperialism. Wen’s declaration here doesn’t even reflect the rhetoric of imperialism. The US and its allies in Europe constantly uphold their right to pursue their own interests in other nations, specifically those nations that have received substantial Western capital. China’s approach is markedly different, as it uses trade as a means of developing African social infrastructure–underdeveloped because of centuries of Western colonial oppression–and functions chiefly on a policy of non-intervention. This reflects the CCP’s commitment to the Marxist-Leninist understanding of national self-determination.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>While China has its shortcomings in terms of foreign relations, particularly its refusal to veto the UN Security Council resolution against Libya, it pursues a qualitatively different foreign policy from any capitalist countries. In terms of trade, China promotes independence and self-determination, where the West promotes dependence, exploitation, and subjugation. Geopolitically, it supports genuine people’s movements against imperialism and provides support to the other existing socialist countries. This is a foreign policy of cooperation deeply influenced by Marxism-Leninism.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>There is <em>a lot more</em> to read in this article. I encourage you to read it all, it's <em>very</em> good, goes on to give numerous examples of how the market reforms in China are very similar to Lenin's NEP, and how the point of the reforms is to <em>build socialism</em> by addressing the contradictions China faces, not to betray it:</p>

            <p>The Chinese government does more than control the flow of investments. They also appoint the top managers.

      <blockquote>

        <p>The main reason for planning is to abolish the anarchy of the market. That is, abolish the competition between large privately owned companies, and replace their competition with a general plan. The central state should not be involved in details which should be taken care of lower down the line. This is more or less how things function in China today.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The SOEs [State Owned Enterprises] completely dominate the capital intensive industries. It is difficult to see how Chinese capitalists will ever be able to compete with the resources of the state in these areas. Not even foreign multi-nationals, with all the resources they have at their command, are able to do so. Even though managers of state firms have some independence in deciding how to dispose over the surplus created by the workers in their industries that does not turn them into capitalists.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>To fully understand the role of the state sector of the economy it is not enough to just look at what proportion they have of GDP, nor the degree of concentration. It is also important, if not more so, to look at what proportion of investments are channelled through the state sector, because investments are the driving force of the economy. And under capitalism, through the mechanism of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, the cause of the boom-slump cycle. Fortunately, statistics about fixedasset investments (investments in buildings and machinery) are also much more accurate and uncontested compared to GDP statistics.</p>

        <p>They are divided into four periods.</p>

        <p>State Investments as Percentage of Total Investments:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>1981 – 1989 (the “roaring eighties”) 78.6 percent</li>

          <li>1990 – 1992 (post-Tiananmen Square) 81.2 percene</li>

          <li>1993 – 2001 (the restructuring of the SOEs) 86.7 percent</li>

          <li>2002 – 2005 (post-reconstruction) 85.3 percent</li>

        </ul>

        <p>These figures are truly astonishing. They show not only that state the plays an absolutely decisive role in the economy, but also that state investments as a proportion of all investments have increased substantially since the eighties, only to fall back slightly between 2002 and 2005. This confirms that rather than moving towards capitalism in the nineties, China moved away from it...</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>When an American professor of economics travelled to Shanghai in 1998 to do field research he asked a government official to introduce him to some private entrepreneurs. The official gave him a quizzical look and asked, “Are you a Harvard professor? As a Harvard professor why are you interested in those people selling watermelons, tea and rotten apples on the street?”</p>

        <p>Now that was probably an exaggerated view of the insignificance of the private sector, at least outside Shanghai, but it is not that far from the truth. Private Chinese companies produce things like pens, socks, shoes, toys, ties, and Christmas decorations. They are big in the building industry. They employ carpenters, plumbers and electricians, but the largest building industry, which is on the Fortune 500 list, is state owned. This company is called China State Construction and employs 294 000 people. The service sector is a much smaller sector than anywhere else in the world compared to manufacturing. </p>

        <p>Services, where 55 percent of all private companies are found, take care of tourists, catering and haircuts among other things. These are hardly sectors that would be nationalised even in a healthy workers state. The independence of private companies is limited, as many are to a certain extent dependent on the state for supplies, distribution and even customers. Symptomatic of this is that in a survey in 1995 of 154 private firms where the state had a minority stake of an average of 30 percent it still had an average of 50 percent of the seats on the boards of these companies. Unlike in the west, proxy voting is not permitted at shareholders meetings. This favours those that own many shares. In China, that is often the state.</p>

        <p>The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets have exploded (and then declined), but this does not either represent a transition to capitalism. An overwhelming proportion of companies traded there are SOEs.</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>If you put it all together the following picture emerges:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>

            <h1>1. About one third of GDP is produced by the SOEs. They are highly concentrated and completely dominate investment. They run the decisive sectors of the economy.</h1>

          </li>

          <li>

            <h1>2. About one third of the economy is private. However, the state has a considerable influence on this sector. Firstly a large part is agriculture, which is heavily dependent on the state, and is run by peasant households that do not want to break their dependence on the state.</h1>

          </li>

          <li>

            <p>Secondly, the state, although a minority shareholder, exercises a disproportionate influence over many private companies. Thirdly, the state through joint-ventures and other means has a high degree of control over foreign multinationals, and dispenses with them as soon as they can build up a domestic alternative. The residual private sector is very small.</p>

          </li>

          <li>

            <h1>3. About one third of GDP is produced by the TVEs. [Township and Village Enterprises. The TVEs consist of small and medium sized businesses, some export oriented, mainly in rural towns and village.] The majority of this is produced by larger TVEs controlled by local governments. The smaller ones are mainly private and are in the poorest and most backward parts of the country.</h1>

          </li>

        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>If the US government nationalised the 1000 largest manufacturing companies, they would have approximately the same control over the American economy as the Chinese state has over the Chinese economy.</em></strong> If in addition, the US state owned all the biggest banks and financial institutions (and almost only lent money to state companies), and a large slice of the service and building industries, not to mention all the land which farmers till, and introduced a five-year plan, almost nobody would deny that a planned economy had been introduced in the USA. </p>
