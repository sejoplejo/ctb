      <p>Read this for an overview of Vietnam's economic history: <a href="http://www.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/English/TheSocialistRepublicOfVietnam/AboutVietnam/AboutVietnamDetail?categoryId=10000103&amp;articleId=10000554">http://www.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/English/TheSocialistRepublicOfVietnam/AboutVietnam/AboutVietnamDetail?categoryId=10000103&amp;articleId=10000554</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>Obviously it's not from an academic journal, but the standard here is fairly high (higher than the garbage published by Western academia tbh). It's definitely useful since you get a basic idea of the degree of destruction that u.$ imperialism brought upon Vietnam:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>April 30, 1975 marked the end of the anti-American war and the complete liberation of South Việt Nam. The country would from now on live in peace and unification but was still faced with difficulties and challenges: <strong>7,850,000 tons of bombs and shells were dropped onto its land (three times as many as those used in World War II, equal to 640 nuclear bombs of the same kind as those dropped by the U.S. on Hiroshima, Japan)</strong>; leaving more than <strong>20 million craters, millions of unexploded bombs and landmines under the ground</strong>; <strong>451,260 tons of toxic chemicals were sprayed on the Southern forests</strong>, seriously destroying the Vietnamese ecology (<strong>50% of the 10-million-hectare forest was carpet-bombed by B52s</strong>) and people (<strong>2 million Vietnamese people intoxicated and 50,000 children deformed</strong>, the consequences are still felt today and will be so for many years to come); <strong>9,000 out of 15,000 villages in South Việt Nam were ruined</strong>. In the North, <strong>almost all cities and towns were raided, in which 12 towns and 51 townships were completely ruined; 4,000 out of 5,788 communes were stricken,</strong> many areas were suffered exterminated. <strong>All power plants and 5 million square meters of housing (excluding those in the countryside)</strong> were seriously destroyed. <strong>All the railway network, 100% of the bridges, the whole system of ports, sea-routes, river-ways and warehouses were raided</strong>. American planes dropped bombs and fired rockets, <strong>causing damage to 1,600 irrigation constructions (including dykes), most of the farms and hundreds of thousands of hectares of fields and gardens, killing 40,000 buffaloes and oxen (the main traction in agriculture), destroying 3,000 schools, 350 hospitals</strong>. Then, from May 1975 to 1989, Việt Nam had to fight two border wars in the Southwest and the North of the country. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Think about what kind of options Vietnam even had in the midst of all these immense difficulties. The country had to be rebuilt from scratch. This is why it's silly to complain about revisionism when people just don't understand the sheer amount of damage that imperialism has caused. This is also why you can't lump Vietnam's market reforms with the Chinese ones, as they were implemented in very different conditions. As such, the attitude of the VCP and the CCP regarding them largely differed at first, although as time passes they become more and more similar (more on this later). </p>

      <p>However, you should definitely skeptical of the underlying narrative about the achievements of the market reforms. For example:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Salaries were not paid according to job efficiency but rather to working results which were measured by quantity and quality. This procedure, therefore, could not encourage talented laborers who worked most efficiently.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This, in my view, is just an ex-post facto rationalization for the reforms that the ended up being the official Party line. According to this narrative, the previous period was "inefficient" and the market reforms were necessary to "fix" the inherent "inefficiency" of the centrally planned economy. (This is similar to what the modern CCP says about the pre-Deng period). For one, once we consider the damage Vietnam suffered from the war, the 1975-1986 period is still an incredible success. Reconstruction and sustaining the army to fight in 2 border conflicts were carried out simultaneously, and yet Vietnam managed to pull through without collapsing or facing a single famine. Aside from that, this narrative wasn't quite the consensus back in the late 80s. On the newspapers in 1988, there was still talk of how the dictatorship of proletariat could oversee the non-socialist sectors and harness them for socialist development. (As opposed to right now, when the term "dictatorship of the proletariat" isn't even mentioned anymore except in textbooks). Back then, the market reforms were considered necessary due to Vietnam's level of underdevelopment; the decision to nationalize all industry and collectivize all agriculture was considered an ultra-left error for the time being, not a flaw of the planned economy itself that needs to be corrected. This probably explains why Vietnam up until recently, has always been behind China in the implementation of market reforms. For instance, Vietnam did not join the WTO until 2006, while China joined 5 years earlier. In fact, here's an interesting article by The Economist back in 1997: </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/1997/05/15/nothing-is-really-private-in-vietnam">https://www.economist.com/asia/1997/05/15/nothing-is-really-private-in-vietnam</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>But for Vietnam this was just the latest of several cases involving extensive official corruption. Some of the ageing Communists who run the country see this as a sad but inevitable by-product of a decade of opening to the outside world and introducing market reforms. Others, however, blame the reforms themselves, and want to slow them down or throw them into reverse. </p>

        <p>The state dominates manufacturing, mining and finance, and is the partner in more than 90% of the joint-ventures set up with foreigners since the reforms began. The state's share of the economy has actually grown from 33% in 1990 to 40% now. Last year, the Communist Party said it wanted the state's share of GDP to increase further, to 60%. </p>

        <p>However, they reaffirmed the state sector's “leading role” and granted “the private capitalist economy” just a grudging mention as being “capable of contributing to national construction”. To make clear that there is something a little mucky about private commerce, Vietnam's party members “must keep from doing private capitalist economic activities”. </p>

        <p>But even many “reforming” Communists would agree with the party leader, Do Muoi, who argued recently that corruption cases would never occur “if state control were strictly tightened”. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>As you can see, unlike in China, skepticism of the market reforms lingered around well into the late 90s, and there was still pressure to go in the opposite direction at the time - which only further shows what the VCP is saying now are justifications stated after the fact. Having said that, the seeds of revisionism was already sown in 1986 with the all the talk about "dismantling the bureaucratic &amp; subsidized centrally planned economy" in favor of "socialist commodity production". </p>

      <p>Additionally, the GDP figures and the poverty reduction isn't at all what seems. I've posted this a few times, but this is a good article outlining why GDP isn't a good measurement:</p>

      <p><a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2012/07/01/the-gdp-illusion/">https://monthlyreview.org/2012/07/01/the-gdp-illusion/</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>There was also an article posted either here or in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/communism">r/communism</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span> which I unfortunately couldn't find. It stated that even if the USSR surpassed the u.$ in terms of productive forces, the GDP of the former could not surpass the latter as prices in the USSR did not follow market trends, large parts of the Soviet economy were not monetized, and as such could not measured. </p>

      <p>While Vietnam has experienced massive GDP growth after integrating into the global economy, this does not necessarily reflect concrete development of the productive forces. Much of that GDP growth comes from fictitious capital (real estate trading, stock trading, partial privatizations), and from labor intensive production controlled by foreign capital. Similarly, the poverty reduction figures were the result of subsidies being lifted, causing people's income to rise above the poverty line. </p>

      <p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>

      <p>Does this mean that there was no progress at all in these aspects? No, but whatever progress that was made, did not happen because of the reasons people often think of. The poverty reduction is actually the result of the embargo being lifted, and Vietnam's socialist legacy: Families under the poverty line were still guaranteed a sort of "iron rice bowl", and were given free access to the farmland, zero/low interests loans, subsidized fertilizer and farming equipment. One only has to look at government documents regarding the poverty reduction programs to see that this is a heavily state backed process. Morons who speak about the "wonders of the free market lifting people out of poverty" are utterly delusional. See this:</p>

      <p><strong>Part 3</strong></p>

      <p>Likewise, the productive forces are still being developed, albeit at a slower pace compared to socialist industrialization in the early 60s (prior to amerikkkan bombing) with Soviet aid. The significant gains however, have come entirely from the state sector: from the universal electrification of the country, the development of petroleum production, to more recent developments like extending internet penetration to rural/remote areas. At best, private capital acts as an extra source of finance, since the state budget can only cover so much. Otherwise, the capitalist sector has failed to bring in any long term benefits. Domestic capitalists mostly have a comprador character, as the Vietnamese bourgeoisie mostly enrich itself off of speculative investments, services, commerce or labor intensive manufacturing for imperialist corporations. Barely any foreign technology gets absorbed, save for a few exceptions: BKAV (a technology firm) and VINGROUP (a conlogmerate) recently got involved in relatively advanced production of smartphones. But this too doesn't really count, as smartphone production is far from capital intensive. The latter also tried to jump start the car manufacturing industry, but I've been informed that the localization rate is fairly low; the engines and the frames are imported from BMW; and the technology is to produce those parts are nearly impossible to obtain because of intellectual property laws. Overall, the nationalist bourgeoisie is smaller and weaker, Vietnamese manufacturing firms that tries to compete with foreign capital are not the norm, they are the anomalies. And even then, there's nothing to indicate that they will succeed, so far none of those conglomerates developed into the Vietnamese equivalent of the southern Korean "chaebols. Above all, the capitalist sector as people in the West would understand constitute merely 8% GDP (and with the problems of GDP as a measurement, the actual contribution to the economy is even lower), with the rest of the "private sector" being dominated by NEP-type petty capitalism.</p>

      <p>So where is Vietnam heading? I don't know. The VCP knows that technology is not being transferred, but it has not given up on this strategy. Historically, Vietnam did not have the luxury to be as selective as China with regards to what kind of foreign capital gets to enter the county. The country just didn't have the same leverage; after facing imperialist backed genocide, and then losing most of its allies, it certainly had a reason to be desperate. This is partly the reason Vietnam did not become the world's workshop, and if we follow the VCP's logic to its conclusion, then Vietnam must do so in order for technology transfer to happen. I guess this is why Vietnam decided to join the TPP/CPTPP: After all, if you want foreign capital to come to Vietnam when they leave China, you must offer them more concessions than China already did. Yet, already this is not working:</p>

      <p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Foxconn-to-assemble-top-end-iPhones-in-India-from-2019">https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Foxconn-to-assemble-top-end-iPhones-in-India-from-2019</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>No matter how many concessions revisionist socialism can offer, it could never match a bourgeois state. Anyhow, if Vietnam sticks to its CPTPP commitments (it probably won't), it will be the first time Vietnam surpasses China in its market reforms. At that point the reforms will reach its limits, anymore would be asking for counter revolution. In a few decades we'll see what happens, and how the VCP would react as global imperialism plunge deeper into crisis.</p>
