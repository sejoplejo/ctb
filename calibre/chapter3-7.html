      <p>Hello comrades, its Odarin again and I am continuing my mini posts debunking Stalin era myths as there is so much hate against him within our very own subreddits. Last post was about Soviet democracy, so go check it out if you haven’t &lt;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/dpbnxr/for_everyone_who_thinks_the_ussr_was_undemocratic/">https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/dpbnxr/for_everyone_who_thinks_the_ussr_was_undemocratic/</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span>&gt;.</p>

      <p>To debunk these myths, I will be using articles from the Criminal Code of RSFSR 1926(some edits from 1956). </p>

      <p>“But my grandma stole some bread and she was sentenced for life in the Gulag”. This is the type of statement a Capitalist or anti - Stalinist makes. However, if we look into the Criminal code it states that - “To combat the most serious types of crimes that threaten the foundations of the Soviet power and the Soviet system, until the Central Executive Committee of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic canceled, in cases specially indicated in the articles of this Code, execution is used as an exceptional measure to protect the state of workers)” - article 21 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</p>

      <p>“A kid stole something, but was sentenced to death anyway, because Stalin and the USSR are evil”. Another fake statement I have heard many times. To counter it, I always state that - “Persons under the age of eighteen at the time the crime was committed and women who are pregnant cannot be sentenced to death” - article 22 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR". </p>

      <p>These are the only crimes under which a court can sentence you to death(Counter revolutionary crimes):</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Betraying the motherland, ie those who - threaten state independence or the inviolability of its territory, such as espionage, the issuance of military or state secrets, switching to the enemy’s side, running or flight abroad. Article 58 para 1a of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</li>

        <li>Any type of armed uprising or invasion of counter-revolutionary purposes on Soviet territory by armed gangs, seizing power in the center or on the ground for the same purposes and, in particular, with the aim of forcibly tearing away any part of its territory from the USSR and a separate union republic or terminating the prisoners of the Union SSR with foreign states treaties. Article 58 para 2 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</li>

        <li>Providing assistance to the international bourgeoisie in any shape or form. Article 58 para 4</li>

        <li>Spying, ie transferring, abducting or collecting top secret information(counted as secret) with the aim of handing it over to counter-revolutionary organizations or private individuals. Article 58 para 6 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</li>

        <li>Counter-revolutionary sabotage, i.e the deliberate non-fulfillment of certain duties or their deliberate careless performance with the special purpose of weakening the power of the government and the activities of the state apparatus. Article 58 para 14 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>These are the only crimes under which a court can sentence you to death(Dangerous crimes):</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Mass riots, accompanied by pogroms, the destruction of railways or other means of communication and communications, killings and other similar actions. Art 59 para 2 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</li>

        <li>Criminal activity, i.e, the organization of armed gangs and participation in them and in the organized attacks on Soviet and private institutions or individual citizens, train stops and the destruction of railways and other means of communication and communication centers. Art 59 para 3 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</li>

        <li>Stealing weapons, weapons parts and ammunition. Art 59 para 3a of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</li>

        <li>Propaganda or agitation aimed at inciting ethnic or religious hatred or hatred, as well as the distribution or production and storage of literature of the same nature. Art 59 para 7 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</li>

        <li>Counterfeiting or selling counterfeit metal coins, state tickets, tickets of the State Bank of the USSR, government papers, as well as counterfeiting or selling for counterfeit foreign currency. Aer 59 para 8 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.</li>

        <li>Smuggling in any form. Art 59 para 9 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR</li>

      </ul>

      <p>These are the only crimes under which a court can sentence you to death(individuals)</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Intentionally killing another individual. Art 136 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The rest are during war times or within the military. </p>

      <p><strong>Keep in mind comrades, if you broke any of these laws the court gets to decide whether or not you would be sentenced to death. However, under some circumstances(court decides), you could get sent to prison rather than getting shot,  from 3 months, up to 10 years(which was not rare).</strong> </p>

      <p>Thus, from this we can conclude that Stalin’s USSR did not randomly shoot people for no reason, as courts needed proper legislation to be able to sentence people to death, neither did it shoot people for petty crimes. Death sentences would be applied to the harshest of crimes against the state and the working class. Hope all my comrades found this useful as I spent some time doing it(for future references too). </p>

      <p>Comrade Odarin. </p>
