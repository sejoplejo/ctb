      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/f9hw8v/how_correct_is_this_article_indigenous/">I made this post here asking how accurate or right this article was overall.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>Turns out? Not so much. While I was left thinking that perhaps the article was simply stating the other side of the story and the idea that perhaps there was more to this rail blockade that meets the eye, I was soon afterwards contacted by a fellow comrade who's name I'll keep anonymous by his request.</p>

      <p>Anyway, here's the Discord interview that I edited down some in order to make sure that any of the admittedly useless comments that I made were deleted. </p>

      <p>---------------------</p>

      <p>Me: Are you indigenous? Are they? What's there description of what's going on? Do you agree with the article that I posted regarding the hereditary chiefs and their position?</p>

      <p>Fellow Comrade: Yes, yes, essentially the wet'suwet'en have inherent title to the land that Canada is trying to push a pipeline through so they are rightfully resisting. Similar to if France were to push a pipeline through Belgium without consulting any of their people or government. That article from what I can remember seems like some Canadian propaganda. They argue a lot of right wing talking points and regurgitate a lot of corporate media points in it</p>

      <p>*I bring up the article in question and he has this to say*</p>

      <p>Comrade: What is happening aren't "protests" they are land defence and anyone affiliated with wet'suwet'en has driven that point hard</p>

      <p>Me: What about the hereditary chiefs? Are they with the defense or against them?</p>

      <p>Comrade: Hereditary chiefs are the rightful decision makers when it comes to the land. This was also confirmed even in Canadian law with the 1997 court case delgaamukw vs the crown. All hereditary chiefs voted against the pipeline, yet it continued to be built. That is what sparked the resistance. Elected chiefs are colonial as fuck. They are part of the Indian act which was imposed on indigenous nations in Canada.</p>

      <p>Me: According to the article above, it said hereditary chiefs, but it seems to be the elected chiefs that are doing this, correct?</p>

      <p>Comrade: Yes. The elected chiefs are the corrupt ass sell-outs to the Canadian state. The vast majority of them voted yes, and that is what Canada is using to say that the pipeline is legitimate. However elected chiefs have no say in this decision according to indigenous law or Canadian law</p>

      <p>Me: So the elected chiefs are in the payroll of the Canadian government? What's their connection to them exactly?</p>

      <p>Comrade: Sort of,but not really. The beauracracy is pretty complicated, but largely they don't give a shit about their nations and are just sellouts to Canada</p>

      <p>Me: So they're like some chiefs in the United States that also sell out to the government. Do I have that right?</p>

      <p>Comrade: Yeah, kinda. With this it is a lil more complicated as there are both hereditary and elected chiefs looking to govern, but the hereditary chiefs are the rightful chiefs.</p>

      <p>Me: To be clear, have the elected chiefs done this sort of thing in the past? Where they would go against the will of their community? Does the indigenous community there want this at all?</p>

      <p>Comrade: I am unfamiliar with the history of decisions between them with wet'suwet'en, but there are many other cases where elected chiefs sell out. TMX is an example of that. There are also those who (rightfully) dont see the elected chiefs as legitimate at all and should have no say in anything, as this elected chief system was again imposed on the indigenous nations with the Indian Act.</p>

      <p>Me: Why is the government of Canada doing this exactly? Does Trudeau have a stake in this project? Are there any strings attached?</p>

      <p>Comrade: Rn, Trudeau is under huge pressure to get it through. Reason being is nearly all of Canada's major banks habe super heavy investment in this, Alberta wants it to bolster their economy, and he is a laughing stock rn as many remember the TMX (which he bought using billions of tax payer money and funds from Indian affairs) which got halted for the same reasons people are standing up to CGL.</p>

      <p>Me: That's right I vaguely remember TMX but it didn't get much traction in the MSM To be clear, does Trudeau's own party want this as well? I'm actually very interested to know what his cohorts think because I consider them to be even worse than Trudeau TBH</p>

      <p>Comrade: Yes, the liberal party is also pushing this hard. Conservatives definitely. Greens supported it for a while but now use it as rhetoric without really materially opposing it, and NDP has essentially been silent as fuck</p>

      <p>Me: One last question, and this might be a strange one, but do you think the Canadian military might have a stake in this project in any way?</p>

      <p>Comrade: I don't know. I haven't really researched them, but I know they  will 100% be used to combat this, just as the militarized police already are. Will look into it though, but I don't think so</p>

      <p>Me: Gotcha</p>

      <p>Comrade: However the way things are going, this will likely turn into another Oka</p>

      <p>Me: You mean the Oka crisis of the 1990s?</p>

      <p>Comrade: That's the one</p>

      <p>Me: Okay, I just thought of another question and then I'll end this interview: what has the overall mainstream media's position been towards the Wet'suwet'en episode and the ensuing rail blockade? Just wondering and then I'll end the interview</p>

      <p>Comrade: Oh, complete fucking opposition. They portray us as protesters, ruffians, paid, maniacs etc. They also do everything they can to drop bits of implicit racism in there stopping just short of saying "chug". A couple good Instagram accounts to follow that amongsts other things are voicesfrontlines, settle_in_settlers, rf_foc and thee.swamp.people</p>

      <p>And if you want a Canadian perspective, all you have to do is check the insta account Canadians_commenting</p>

      <p>Me: You've convinced me and your story pretty much check out compared to the article I read, which seemed to not really make much sense. Thanks, comrade</p>

      <p>Comrade: I mean, the worst has been Global News (also one of Canada's most popular news orgs), and if you follow their paper trail they are owned by Suncor, a company that has huge investment in the Alberta tar sands so, news is going to be a definite pro colonial propaganda outlet</p>

      <p>*Afterwards, I asked him if I could relay what was said to you guys and he assented so long as I didn't include his username so I call him here "Fellow Comrade" or "Comrade." We both said cheers to each other afterwards and that was about it. I planned to give this interview to you guys earlier but I was not feeling up to it the past two days and was busy. Sorry for the delay. I hope you found this interview informative.*</p>
