      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

      <p>The following thread is a detailed overview that I have written about the anti-soviet anarchist movement in Russia and the Ukraine following the October Revolution. The aim of this thread is to shed light on the criminal and treacherous acts that the anti-soviet anarchists committed which are either deliberately or unknowingly ignored by the vast majority of contemporary anarchists.</p>

      <p><strong>The Soviet Anarchists</strong></p>

      <p>I’d like to make something clear from the start that lots of modern anarchists fail to recognise. Scores of anarchists in Soviet Russia were ardent defenders of the Soviet regime; giving their energy in battle, their lives at the front and their participation in the soviet institutions. The Bolsheviks worked alongside these anarchists and regarded them as their comrades.</p>

      <p>Four anarchists, Bogatsky, Bleikhman, Shatov and Iatshurk were members of the Military Revolutionary Committee which carried out the October Revolution — the insurrection which today’s anarchists (wrongfully) denounce as a coup d'état. The armed detachment carrying out the orders of the Soviet Government to dissolve the Constituent Assembly was led by an anarchist named Anatoly Zheleteznyakov. Almost all anarchists were opposed to the bourgeois Constituent Assembly in revolutionary Russia, yet today’s anarchists denounce the Bolsheviks’ decision to dissolve it as having been “anti-democratic”. How ironic!</p>

      <p>An extract from Jeff Hemmer gives more detail about the aforementioned Vladimir Shatov and other anarchists who staunchly defended the Soviet regime:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“A member of the Military Revolutionary Committee in 1917, Shatov became the chief of police in Petrograd in 1918. In 1919 he defended Petrograd against the advance of General Yudenich as an officer in the Tenth Red Army, and in 1920 was appointed Minister of Transport in the Far Eastern Republic. A number of other anarchists followed his example and accepted small government posts, urging their comrades to do the same or at least refrain from anti-Bolshevik activities that would jeopardize the revolution. The Bolshevik cause attracted anarchists from all backgrounds, ranging from former Black Banner terrorists like Heitzman and Roschin to Anarcho-Communists like German Sandomirskii, who took a position in Chicherin’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, and Alexander Ge, according Victor Serge one of the organisers of Red Terror in the Terek region. Other well-known anarchists in the service of the Bolsheviks were the Anarcho-Syndicalists Shapiro, who joined Sandomirskii in the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, and Daniil Novomirskii, in 1905 a prominent figure in syndicalist circles in Odessa, who entered the Communist Party and became a Comintern official in 1919…</p>

        <p>In spring 1918 the Anarcho-Communist Apollon Karelin formed the pro-Bolshevik All-Russian Federation of Anarchist-Communists in Moscow, arguing that a Soviet dictatorship was acceptable as a transitional phase in the development of a free anarchist society. According to Karelin, the defence of the Soviet Government was to be regarded not as an affirmation of authority, but as a means of protecting the revolution. A similar view was put forward by the Moscow-based Universalists, formed in 1920 by the brothers Gordin, who had previously been rabid anti-Marxists and anti-intellectuals, and German Askarov, an Anarchist-Communist who was also a member of the Soviet Central Executive Committee [as was Karelin from 1918 – MM]. Roschin, the former Chernoznamenets and staunch anti-Marxist who, in 1919, came to see the Bolsheviks as “the advance guard of the revolution,” seems to have taken these ideas even further; according to Victor Serge, he tried to develop an “anarchist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.”</p>

        <p>The support from the “Soviet Anarchists” was welcomed by the Bolshevik leadership, who insisted that the only anarchists that were persecuted in Russia were criminal elements.” <sup>[1]</sup></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>It is, of course, precisely these “criminal elements” that we shall now discuss.</p>

      <p><strong>The Dawn Of Anarchist Black Guards</strong></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“In the first period of Soviet power, a lot of bands flourished in Great Russia. They were all annihilated long ago: their guiltiest members were shot, and the rest are expiating their crimes in places of detention. The same fate awaits the bandits of Ukraine. Firm, reliable units have been sent to all parts of the Ukraine, with the task of finding and collecting arms, catching deserters and exterminating bands. The purge will be carried through to the end.” <sup>[2]</sup></p>

        <p>– LEON TROTSKY (A WORD TO THE UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS MISLED BY BANDITS).</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Before talking about Nestor Makhno and his Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, one first has to understand where this Makhnovist “Black Army” came from. The answer lies in the anarchist Black Guards which flourished throughout Russia and Ukraine in 1918. Originally created in Alexandrovsk during the summer of 1917 by Maria Nikiforova, these armed anarchist detachments had spread to Moscow by January 1918, and by April 1918 “there were already more than 50 groups and detachments of the Black Guard, numbering some 2,000 militants” In the city. <sup>[3]</sup></p>

      <p>“All groups and organisational units of the Black Guard were grouped around the Council of the MFAG [Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups – MM] and headquarters of the Black Guard, stationed in the House of Anarchy in Malaya Dmitrovka.” <sup>[4]</sup> Nestor Makhno would later establish similar detachments in different regions of Ukraine which ultimately grew into the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine.
According to the American anarchist historian Paul Avrich, the MFAG armed the Black Guards “with rifles, pistols, and grenades. From their headquarters in the House of Anarchy, the leaders of the Federation tried to impose a measure of discipline on the Black Guardsmen and to limit the activities of the local clubs to the distribution of propaganda and the “requisitioning” of private residences. This proved to be an impossible task; once armed, a number of groups and isolated individuals succumbed to the temptation of carrying out “expropriations,” and, adding insult to injury, they sometimes acted in the name of the Federation.” <sup>[5]</sup></p>

      <p>Avrich explains that “armed detachments of Black Guards… held up banks, shops and private homes. Many of their comrades — especially the “Soviet anarchists” – condemned such acts as parodies of the libertarian ideal, which wasted precious lives, demoralized the movement’s true adherents and discredited anarchism in the eyes of the general public.” <sup>[6]</sup></p>

      <p>Looting was rife among the Black Guards. The leadership of the MFAG seemed unable to discipline its detachments. The Bolshevik (and former anarchist) Victor Serge wrote that  “The anarchists themselves admitted that suspicious elements, adventurers, common criminals and counter-revolutionaries, were thriving among them, but their libertarian principles did not permit them to refuse entrance to their organizations to any man, or to subject anyone to real control. They sensed acutely that their movement needed to be purged, but this was impossible without authority or a disciplined organization. Splits among them and this reverence for principle was slowly leading to the political suicide of the movement, which was becoming more compromised each day…” <sup>[7]</sup></p>

      <p>The situation was — excuse the pun — anarchic. The Black Guards were out of control. “Several incidents such as an attack on an American car, the murder of several Cheka agents followed by the summary execution of several bandits, the arrests of “expropriators” who were promptly claimed by the Anarchist Federation, led Dzerzhinsky, the President of the Cheka, to insist on the liquidation of the Black Guard.” <sup>[8]</sup></p>

      <p>Avrich gives the details of this operation:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“[O]n the night of the 11-12th of April, armed detachments of the Cheka raided 26 anarchist centres in the capital. Most anarchists surrendered without a fight, but in the Donskoi Monastery and the House of Anarchy itself, Black Guardsmen offered fierce resistance. A dozen Cheka agents were slain in the struggle, about 40 anarchists were killed or wounded, and more than 500 were taken prisoner.” <sup>[9]</sup></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Anarchist propagandists with their dishonest “selective memory” take this evening’s events out of historical context; treating it in isolation and ignoring the backwards trend of conflict that the anarchist Black Guards had been unleashing in Russia. The Bolsheviks had been forced into carrying out the task that the anarchists were seemingly incapable of achieving on their own; purging from their ranks the “criminal elements” that were pillaging and burgling under the flag of anarchism and causing chaos throughout Russia. As the elected and legitimate government it was their obligation to restore order.</p>

      <p>The Bolsheviks sought to eradicate these “criminal elements” which were considered to be “pseudo-anarchists.” In their view no genuine anarchist could condone random acts of theft and violence against workers and the soviets’ officials. Trotsky stated in Moscow on the 14th of April that “these hooligans… are simply raiders and burglars who compromise the anarchists. Anarchism is an idea although a mistaken one, but hooliganism is hooliganism… I have talked about it to the idealist anarchists and they themselves say: ‘A lot of these jailbirds, hooligans, and criminals have smuggled themselves into our movement…’… It is stated that among these hooligans there are a few who are honest anarchists; if that is true… then it is a great pity, and it is necessary to render them their freedom as quickly as possible.”  His general argument was that the “honest anarchists” should distance themselves from the “hooligans” so that “one should know once for all… that is a burglar, and this is an honest idealist…” This was not an attack against anarchism or the “honest” anarchists. It was an attack against “the hooligans, who put on the mask of anarchism in order to destroy the order and life and labour of the working class.” Yet “some fifteen anarchists demonstratively left the hall” creating a frightening scene, breaking solidarity and order. <sup>[10]</sup></p>

      <p>And before long the anarchists would resort “once more to their terrorist ways.” According to Avrich: “Anarchists in Rostov, Ekaterinoslav and Briansk broke into city jails and liberated the prisoners” in the middle of a civil war. “[I]n the summer of 1918, Black Guardsmen who had survived the Cheka raids of the preceding months, contemplated the armed seizure of the capital but Aleksei Borovoi and Daniil Novomirskii talked them out of it.” <sup>[11]</sup> But according to the historian Marcel Liebman — evidently against the wishes of Borovoi and Novomirskii — some anarchists were involved in the Left SR revolt in Moscow on the 6th and 7th of July, which was of course an “armed seizure of the capital” that was quickly crushed. <sup>[12]</sup></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“Lev Chernyi, secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchists… joined an organization called the Underground Anarchists, founded by Kazimir Kovalevich, a member of the Moscow Union of Railway Workers, and a Ukrainian anarchist named Petr Sobolev. Though based in the capital, the Underground Anarchists established ties with the battle detachments of the south… On the 25th of September [1919 – MM], together with a number of Left SR’s, they bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party in Leontiev Street, while a plenary meeting was in session. The explosion killed 12 members of the Committee and wounded 55 others, including Nikolai Bukharin, the eminent Bolshevik theorist and editor of Pravda…” <sup>[13]</sup></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>But even while chaos ensued on the streets of Moscow — terrorism conducted under the flag of anarchism — the Bolsheviks tried their best to meet the “honest” anarchists halfway:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“When Kamenev in 1920 offered the Moscow Anarchists freedom to issue their papers and to run their clubs and bookshops in exchange for their adoption of party discipline and a purge of the criminal and irresponsible elements which had infiltrated into their membership, they indignantly rejected the offer.” <sup>[14]</sup></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>It’s clear then from the information I’ve provided that contrary to anarchist mythology the Bolsheviks did not “crush” the anarchists in Soviet Russia for ideological reasons. The Bolsheviks – alongside the anarchists who peacefully collaborated with them – appealed to sincere anarchists involved in dubious activity to distance themselves from the hooligans who had infiltrated their ranks. The “anarchists” who were subdued had been looting, burgling, engaging in violent and destructive acts and assassinating government figures. The “repression” of these explicitly anti-soviet and counter-revolutionary terrorists should be seen as nothing more than an overdue retaliation to criminal provocation.</p>

      <p><strong>The Makhnovite Plunders And Pogroms</strong></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“Makhnovism is one-tenth idealism and nine-tenths plundering and violence.” <sup>[15]</sup></p>

        <p>– LEON TROTSKY (BUILDING THE RED ARMED FORCES).</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The Cheka’s raids on the anarchist centres in 1918 caused a number of anti-soviet anarchists to travel to the Ukraine – where Nestor Makhno (according to anarchist mythology) had established an “anarchist” stronghold. But in truth most of the Makhnovist fighters were peasant small-holders who couldn’t have cared less about anarchism. <sup>[16]</sup> “The handful of agricultural communes established in the Gulyai-Pole region encompassed only a small fraction of its followers. The overwhelming majority of Makhno’s partisans were committed to their own private property.” <sup>[17]</sup></p>

      <p>The Makhnovists were one of several guerrilla bands that had allied with the Bolsheviks and became units of the Ukrainian Soviet Army in 1919. “Makhno’s forces were assigned a strategically vital section of the Red Army’s Southern Front facing the counter-revolutionary White Army of the former Tsarist general Denikin.” <sup>[18]</sup> But even during his time as a commander of the Ukrainian Soviet Army, Makhno deliberately stole from and undermined his Bolshevik allies. The historian Arthur Adams writes that “Makhno supplied himself, sometimes by commandeering entire Bolshevik supply trains meant for the Southern Front... Soviet food collectors and political institutions found it impossible to function in the region under his domination.” <sup>[19]</sup></p>

      <p>The Makhnovists demanded that the Bolshevik government supply them with munitions to use in the fight against the Whites. But the Makhnovists also refused to allow Soviet grain collectors into region under their control. The Makhnovists had therefore sought economic assistance from the Bolsheviks but refused to return the favour; often resulting in violent clashes between the Makhnovist guerrillas and Soviet grain collectors. </p>

      <p>Trotsky (Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs) wrote that “[S]ince the Makhnovists are sitting on the railway branch-line from Mariupol, they are refusing to allow the coal and grain to leave except in exchange for other supplies... [T]he Makhnovites are trying to establish domination by gangs and bands: whoever has grabbed something is its rightful owner, and can then exchange it for whatever he hasn’t got. This is not products-exchange but commodity-stealing.” <sup>[20]</sup></p>

      <p>On May 7th 1919 another Ukrainian guerrilla leader named Grigorev – who like Makhno had collaborated with the Bolsheviks – mutinied against the Red Army’s command. Grigorev declared that the Bolsheviks were his new main target and called for an anti-Bolshevik alliance that included the White Guards. The Whites’ anti-semitism was no issue for Grigorev – he himself was a pogromist. According to the Encyclopedia Judaica, Grigorev was responsible for pogroms in 40 communities and the deaths of an estimated 6,000 Jews during the summer of 1919. <sup>[21]</sup></p>

      <p>Makhno – while initially remaining neutral towards Grigorev’s revolt – also took action against the Bolsheviks. On May 29th Makhno retreated behind the frontlines, abandoning his command and collaboration with the Reds. The historian Michael Palij writes that “As soon as Makhno left the front he and his associates began to organise new partisan detachments in the Bolsheviks’ rear, which subsequently attacked strongholds, troops, police, trains and food collectors.” <sup>[22]</sup>  </p>

      <p>In July, Makhno and Grigorev entered a short-lived alliance that didn’t end well for the latter. Though I won't go into that now because I'll be talking about it in more detail later. But the combined force of the Makhnovists, Grigorevites and other guerrilla detachments attacking the Bolsheviks at the same time greatly weakened the strength of the Red Army, playing a major role in the collapse of the Southern Front and allowing Denikin’s White Guards to seize most of Ukraine by the fall of 1919.</p>

      <p>After Denikin’s defeat in 1920 Makhno was still fighting against the Reds but he later offered to enter a joint alliance against Denikin’s new successor – the White general Wrangel. Concerned about whether or not Makhno could be trusted given his past betrayals, the Bolsheviks demanded Makhno to purge his ranks of bandits and incorporate his forces into the Red Army. Trotsky – addressing this new Makhnovist/Bolshevik alliance – wrote on October 10th 1920:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“We, of course, can only welcome the fact that the Makhnovites wish henceforth not to fight against us but with us, against Wrangel. But our pact with the Makhnovites must certainly not be temporary in character. The working class of the Ukraine can never, and especially not in conditions of tremendous military danger, allow particular units sometimes to fight in our ranks and sometimes stab us in the back.” <sup>[23]</sup></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The Bolsheviks were looking for a stable and continued alliance with Makhno – not one that would break down and falter the minute their common foe was defeated. But in Makhno’s view this alliance was to be nothing more than a short-term convenience – and for this reason he refused to recognise the Red Army’s regulations.</p>

      <p>After Wrangel’s defeat the Makhnovists tried to establish themselves as an autonomous fighting force in Crimea. Had the Makhnovists been successful the Bolsheviks would have lost vital infrastructure and the Ukraine would have become a magnet for enemies of the Bolshevik government. Knowing Makhno’s hostile track record – not to mention his willingness to enter alliances with dubious anti-Bolshevik forces like Grigorev – the Bolsheviks viewed this as the final straw. The Bolsheviks therefore moved to end the Makhnovist movement once and for all and succeeded in doing so.</p>

      <p>Libertarian mythologists like to argue that the Bolsheviks “crushed” the Makhnovists because of their formal anarchist convictions. Of course – as I’ve shown – this is not the case. It was the Makhnovists’ hostile actions that fermented their demise. Their ideology – though mistaken and utopian – was totally irrelevant. </p>

      <p>Finally, I’d like to touch on the connection between the Makhnovists and anti-semitic pogroms. While the anarchists are correct to argue that Makhno himself was not an anti-semite, this statement says absolutely nothing about the actions of the Makhnovist fighters on the ground. Numerous eyewitness accounts of anti-semitic pogroms conducted by the Makhnovist guerrillas have been compiled by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. <sup>[24]</sup> I’ve yet to find a single anarchist that has scrutinised the reliability of this seemingly damning evidence. But regardless it’s an incontestable fact that the Makhnovists had pogromists among their ranks.</p>

      <p>How so? Because as I alluded to earlier, Makhno and Grigorev entered a short-lived alliance against the Bolsheviks in 1919. But Grigorev’s willingness to co-operate with any and all anti-Bolshevik forces including Denikin conflicted sharply with Makhno’s anarchist convictions. Furthermore, Grigorev’s track record of military opportunism and unpredictability meant that Makhno didn't trust him. This alliance broke down within less than a month, resulting in the death of Grigorev at the hand of Makhno and the absorption of Grigorev’s partisans into Makhno’s army.
The following is an eyewitness account from the anarchist Arishnov:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“July 27, 1919, in the village of Sentovo, near Aleksandriya, in Kherson guberniya, on the initiative of Makhno there was an assembly of the rebels of Ekaterinoslav, Kherson, and Taurida. In agreement with the agenda, the session had to decide upon the task of all rebels of the Ukraine relating to the current situation. The assembled mass of peasants, the rebel sections of Grigorev, and the units of Makhno came to about 20,000 people. Grigorev and Makhno and a series of other supporters of this or that movement were designated as reporters. First came Grigorev. He summoned the peasants and rebels to give all their forces to drive the Bolsheviks out of the country, scorning no allies in this work. Grigorev was not opposed to unification with Denikin for this purpose. Later, when the yoke of Bolshevism had been overturned, the people themselves would decide what should be done.</p>

        <p>This declaration proved fatal for Grigorev. Chubenko and Makhno, speaking immediately after him, showed that the struggle with the Bolsheviks could be revolutionary only if it were carried on in the name of social revolution. Collaboration with the most evil enemies of the people – with the generals – would be criminal adventure and counter-revolution. “Grigorev calls [us] to this counter-revolution; consequently, he is the enemy of the people.” Then Makhno publicly, before all the assembly, demanded that Grigorev immediately pay for the monstrous pogrom perpertrated by him in May 1919, at Elisavetgrad, and for a series of other anti-semitic actions.</p>

        <p>“Such blackguards as Grigorev degrade all the rebels of Ukraine, and for them there can be no place in the ranks of the honourable workers of the revolution.” Thus Makhno concluded his accusation of Grigorev. The latter saw that the affair was taking a terrible end for him. He reached for his gun. But he was too late. Simon Karetnik – the closest assistant of Makhno – drove him to the ground with several bullets from his Colt, and Makhno, triumphantly proclaiming “Death to the Ataman!” shot him dead. The friends and members of Grigorev’s staff would have rushed to help him, but were shot on the spot by a group of Makhno’s men previously designated for the task. All this occurred within the course of two or three minutes before the eyes of the assembly…</p>

        <p><strong>According to the protocol decreed by the assembly, the Makhnovtsy took upon themselves the responsibility for the deed and its consequences. All the partisan sections that had been under the direction of Grigorev, in agreement with the resolution of the assembly were absorbed into the general army of the Makhnovist rebels.”</strong></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Regardless of Makhno’s noble reasons for killing Grigorev the fact remains that Makhno and his colleagues knowingly recruited en masse into their ranks Grigorev’s men who only a few months before had massacred 3,000 Jews in Elisavetgrad. It is therefore indisputable that Makhno’s army contained anti-semitic pogromists. The evidence from YIVO simply serves to reinforce the charge of anti-semitism among the Makhnovists. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“It would be a mistake to assume that the peasants in the region of the Makhno movement were anarchists; in reality, they knew and cared little about anarchism or Marxism… Although some of the anarchist principles were quite compatible with traditional peasant aspirations, the basic desire of Ukrainian peasants was not the creation of an anarchist utopia but the expulsion of all the foreign invaders who exploited them and disrupted their way of life.”</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Trotsky shares this view in Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“Only an entirely superficial person can see in Makhno’s bands or in the Kronstadt revolt a struggle between the abstract principles of anarchism and ‘state socialism’. Actually these movements were convulsions of the peasant petty bourgeoisie which desired, of course, to liberate itself from capital but which at the same time did not consent to subordinate itself to the dictatorship of the proletariat.”</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Arishinov (an ardent defender of Makhno) testifies in his History of the Makhnovist Movement:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>“The majority of Russian anarchists… stood aside, asking what kind of a movement this was, why they should relate to it, and without moving they consoled themselves with the thought that the movement did not seem to be purely anarchist.”</p>
