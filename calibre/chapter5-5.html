      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

      <p>Hello comrades. To celebrate the recent anniversary of the Sandinista revolution, let's go over some of their remarkable achievements.</p>

      <p>As always, sources will be listed at the end.</p>

      <p><strong>Economic and Nutritional Indicators</strong></p>

      <p>The Sandinistas have successfully brought about significant improvements to Nicaragua's economy and quality of life.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#country/157">data</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span> from the FAO, the Sandinistas' policies have led to a drastic reduction in malnutrition.</p>

      <p>On top of that, data from the World Bank shows that <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/country/nicaragua">the Sandinistas have cut poverty in half in Nicaragua</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span>.</p>

      <p>According to a <a href="https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/56510/ltc122.pdf?sequence=1">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span> from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Sandinista land reform program made great progress in improving life for agricultural workers:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Nicaraguan agrarian reform accomplished more during its first year of operation than most agrarian reforms achieve over much longer periods... Rural workers were organized into a strong, national union, and began to receive better wages and to participate in government policy formulation and implementation. The necessary institutional framework for effective agricultural research, planning, and administration began to be developed. Finally, production levels by the end of 1980 were, with the exception of cotton, nearly those of pre-war levels for export crops, and at a par or higher for basic grains for the internal market. These accomplishments were all the more impressive given the widespread destruction and crop failures facing Nicaragua at the end of the war.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>These accomplishments must be appreciated.</p>

      <p><strong>Healthcare Achievements</strong></p>

      <p>After the Nicaraguan revolution, the healthcare system was greatly improved. According to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1651882/pdf/amjph00633-0082.pdf">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span> in the <em>American Journal of Public Health:</em></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Before the Nicaraguan revolution of 1979, access to health services was largely limited to the affluent sectors of the urban population and the minority of workers with social security coverage. Repeated attempts at reform by organized medicine were ineffective. Since the revolution, a tremendous expansion in health services has occurred.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Access to healthcare expanded massively, and a focus on preventative care was developed. According to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/340747306/Nicaragua-The-threat-of-a-good-example">report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5]" title="press 5 to open link"></span> from Oxfam:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Whereas it is estimated that in 1979 little more than a quarter of the population could obtain medical services, by 1982 about 70% of Nicaraguans had regular access to healthcare. In the process, there was a radial shift from primarily curative, urban-based care for a privileged minority to an emphasis on on prevention, which is particularly striking in the area of maternal and child care.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>These policies led to sharp improvements in the population's health conditions. According to the aforementioned <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1651882/pdf/amjph00633-0082.pdf">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Developments in health services, prevention activities, and education may be related to rapid improvements in the population's health status since 1979. It is estimated that, between 1978 and 1983, infant mortality decreased from 121 to 80.2 per 1,000 live births, life expectancy at birth rose from 52 to 59 years. The number of reported malaria cases has decreased by 50 per cent, polio cases have not been reported for two years, no measles cases were reported in the first half of 1984, and most other immunization preventable diseases are considerably reduced.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The social security system was also largely expanded:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The social security system is expanding rapidly. Since 1979, the percentage of the working population covered by social security has doubled, from 16 per cent to 32 per cent. Perhaps more importantly, most of the newly covered groups work in the formerly neglected agricultural sectors in outlying parts of the country. INSS coverage provides retirement insurance and workers' compensation among other non-medical benefits.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>These are major achievements, which should be celebrated.</p>

      <p><strong>Education and Literacy</strong></p>

      <p>According to a <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000146007">report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[7]" title="press 7 to open link"></span> from UNESCO, the Sandinista literacy campaign was an immense success:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The outcomes of the campaign were something to be proud of... Nicaragua made a substantial contribution to the world’s experience in finding solutions to eradicate illiteracy.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The literacy rate improved dramatically, from approx. 50% to less than 13%:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>In five months 95,582  brigadistas achieved in teaching 406,056 Nicaraguans to read and to write in Spanish so that the illiteracy rate of 50.35% could be reduced by 37.39 percentage  points to 12.96%.  In the more industrialized Pacific region the illiteracy rate was reduced from 28.06 to 7.8%, in the central mountain region from 66.74% to 20.21%, and in the least developed Atlantic region the leap was biggest with 78.07% to 25.59%.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The campaign was a great benefit to the marginalized people of Nicaragua:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>It brought tangible evidence to the most marginalized groups of Nicaraguans that the society was going to include them and the revolutionary movement change their lives for  the  better.  The  campaign  was  designed  as part  of  a  social  transformation process aiming at the redistribution of power and wealth. The campaign helped people to develop basic skills, knowledge and attitudes conducive to this transformation.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This must be appreciated.</p>

      <p><strong>Social Policy and Gender Equality</strong></p>

      <p>According to the World Economic Forum, gender equality in Nicaragua has greatly improved under the Sandinistas. This is noted in a <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/86769.html">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[8]" title="press 8 to open link"></span> from the University of Munich:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>For the last five years, the World Economic Forum’s annual Global Gender Gap Index has been reporting that Nicaragua is one of the most gender equal countries in the world. This is the culmination of a remarkable increase in gender equality in Nicaragua during the past decade, charted by the same index.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Women also benefited greatly from various Sandinista programs, such as the aforementioned literacy campaign. According to the UNESCO <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000146007">report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[9]" title="press 9 to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>For many women the literacy campaign signified an opportunity for emancipation: 60% of the brigadistas were female, as were some 50% of the literacy learners. The separation of the teaching force (Popular Literacy Army) according to men and women increased the leadership opportunities for female brigadistas</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

      <p>While the Sandinistas have undeniably committed major mistakes in recent years (such as their growing affinity for neoliberal policies, austerity, etc.), their achievements cannot be denied. This is especially true when we consider the terrible conditions they endured during the war, and the hostility of the US government since then.</p>
