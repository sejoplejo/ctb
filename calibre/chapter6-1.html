      <p>American patronage of the SDF and the creation of a Syrian Kurdish state serves strategic American policies and pursuits through control of key resources, a weakened Syrian state and a stage from which to contain Iran. Syrian Kurdish leadership has exploited this alliance and the chaos of war to unilaterally federalize (without national referendum). The two actors need each other, but we should not mistake which actor holds power. Balkanization aligns with Kurdish interests but occupation projects American dominance and enriches its ruling class.</p>

      <p>In this context you can see Hasakah as not an aberration or an irrelevance. The SDF battled the SAA for control of a key gateway during the height of its fight against ISIS. Reports of Kurdish ethnic cleansing go back to 2015 afaik. Thus the Kurds weren't just ridding themselves from ISIS, they were pursuing territory, resources and demographic change. The 'civil war' produced favorable conditions for secession and in pursuit of their own interests the Kurds acted. As the US supported the SDF with air power, artillary and personnel there would be no revolution without American patronage. In another action little noticed last year the US fired upon the SAA in Deir Ezzor, as SAR tried to reclaim its rightful oil resources. 100 SAA dead. These actions are viewed in isolation only because of mystification of American occupation.</p>

      <p>Rojava isn't organized on a basis of class struggle. It's incorrect to say their state will advance class struggle in any way more so than Syria. An egalitarian ideal and the pursuit of gender rights isn't class struggle in itself. The Kurdish bourgeoisie has abandoned Rojava to Western cities. The remainder is a movement of middle and proletarian classes. The middle component has an interest in maintaining the state as an agent of global capital. The question of class struggle is subsumed into a struggle for radical Kurdish identity. </p>

      <p>Syria is in itself a progressive, pluralist and secular state, a historically postcolonial socialist state which has admirably protected minority rights. Of course in the West we never hear of Syria's successes. Syria is Enemy and relentlessly demonized, while coverage of Rojava as the "best hope" in the Middle East is noisy and incessant. A successful propagandization campaign both stoked and exploited by Kurdish political leadership and by our ruling class in pursuit of its Middle Eastern interests.</p>

      <p>I can't say if Kurds had better options than alliance but the result is clear. The Kurdish state is won at the cost of Syrian territorial integrity, and born from an opportunistic exploitation of war chaos. Rojava, via US occupation now control 30% grain fields and 95% oil fields. The US has brokered oil sales which net Rojava a hefty $10 million/month. It is in US interest that a Kurdish state provide for its people, as long as Syria is deprived of critical resources and profits by which it could recover. As it is still official policy that "Assad must go" a feeble economy unable to recover aligns. Syrian people endure long fuel and bread lines and Rojava profits. Those fields belong to the SAR, seized during war and controlled by American occupiers and client.</p>

      <p>To demystify Rojava we have to understand the Kurdish question. Samir Amin has argued that Kurds are a contestable nationhood. The language is dialectically distinct via region. The bourgeois classes adopt host state languages. Persian Kurds speak Farsi. Kurds acted as Turkish agents in the Assyrian Genocide and doubled their territory in the seizure of these lands.</p>

      <p>[Assyrians transferred to Northern Syria post-genocide and live in close contact with their historical aggressors. They are particularly bitter and mistrustful of Kurdish expansionist ethno-nationalism. In this war Kurdish militias have seized vacated homes and properties, interfered with school curriculum and are implicated in the assassination attempt of a Syriac political leader.]</p>

      <p>In Syria, Kurdish nationalism is backward nationalism. Kurds make up 7-10% of the population. Most important, Syrian Kurdish nationalism is not an anti-colonial anti-imperialist struggle. It fails the most basic tenet of ML yet, we are so mystified by this complex situation that we vacilitate toward Rojava and waver in our support for Syria which has had its sovereignty barbarously violated. Syria is the aggressed not the aggressor let's not forget it.</p>

      <p>The current situation is an American occupation, likely indefinite, of 30% Syria. Rojava is an instrument of that occupation. Approximately 4000 troops remain, ten bases and unaccounted PMC and support personnel. Given the FP primacy to Iranian containment, American military planners have spoken of a 'Sunnistan' spanning Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish territory. It is through these territories that America can contain Iran as well as launch destabilizing efforts. It is fantastically naive to believe Rojava will exercise control over US bases, personnel or anti-Iran actions. The more we distract ourselves with discussion of the success or failure of the revolution on its own merits the more we mystify imperialist aggression and occupation.</p>
