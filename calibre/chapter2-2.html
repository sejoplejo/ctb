      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

      <p>The Republic of Cuba has had an extraordinary political influence for a nation its size. Its revolution served as an inspiration to victims of imperialism everywhere, and its socialist model has provided an example for the oppressed people of the world to follow. As such, it is the duty of all socialists to be well-informed about this nation.</p>

      <p>As always, all sources will be listed at the end.</p>

      <p><strong>Pre-Revolutionary Cuba</strong></p>

      <p>Before learning about the achievements of Cuban socialism, we should take a moment to examine what life was like before the revolution. Fulgencio Batista's defenders will typically claim that living standards were better before the revolution. However, a quick examination of the facts will show this to be nonsense. It is true that Batista's reign saw relatively high GDP growth; however, human development indicators paint a far bleaker picture. According to a <a href="https://www.coralgablescavaliers.org/ourpages/users/099346/IB%20History/Americas/Cuba/Cuba_s%20Food%20Rationing.pdf">paper</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span> from Cornell University:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Opinions aside, although Cuba ranked as one of the most prosperous developing countries in the 1950s based on gross domestic product (GDP), social indicators for this period portray dismal social conditions, particularly among the rural peasants.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Batista's regime left the Cuban people (especially the large rural population) mired in poverty and illness. According to the aforementioned paper, contemporary studies reported a 91% malnutrition rate among agricultural workers. Though some commentators consider this figure to be too high, "it nonetheless conveys the magnitude of rural impoverishment." Health conditions are summarized by a <a href="https://caribbean.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0043-31442013000300015&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span> in the <em>West Indian Medical Journal:</em></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Poor hygiene, inefficient sanitation and malnutrition [contributed] to the infant mortality rate of 60 per 1000 lives, maternal mortality rate of 125.3 per 1000, [and] a general mortality rate of 6.4 per 1000.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The rural population in particular suffered from dismal health conditions; according to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3464859/">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span> published in the <em>American Journal of Public Health:</em></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Cuba had only 1 rural hospital, only 11% of farm worker families drank milk, and rural infant mortality stood at 100 per 1000 live births.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Infrastructure was also pitifully underdeveloped under Batista. According to the aforementioned Cornell paper:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>According to the 1953 census, 54.1 percent of rural homes had no toilets of any kind. Only 2.3 percent of rural homes had indoor plumbing, compared with 54.6 of urban homes. In rural areas, 9.1 percent of houses had electricity, compared with 87 percent of houses in urban areas.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Illiteracy and unemployment were widespread under Batista:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Nearly one-quarter of people 10 years of age and older could not read or write, and the unemployment rate was 25 percent.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The high illiteracy rate is hardly surprising when one remembers the shoddy state of education in pre-revolutionary Cuba. According to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/05/cuban-development-model">article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span> in the <em>Guardian:</em></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>In 1958, under the Batista dictatorship, half of Cuba's children did not attend school.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>All of this is not even mentioning the imperialist domination, organized crime, and rampant exploitation that the Cuban people endured throughout Batista's reign. With all of this in mind, let us move on to examining the Cuban revolution and its achievements.</p>

      <p><strong>Economic and Nutritional Indicators After the Revolution</strong></p>

      <p>Since the very beginning, the Cuban revolution has been committed to the improvement of life for the people in both the economic and social spheres. According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090303221405/http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/OA-Cuba_Social_Policy_at_Crossroads-en.pdf">report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5]" title="press 5 to open link"></span> from Oxfam America:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>When Cuba’s revolution came to power in 1959, its model of development aimed to link economic growth with advances in social justice.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>According to United Nations data, the unemployment rate in Cuba <a href="http://data.un.org/en/iso/cu.html">remains below 3%</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span>, as it has for decades. Unofficial rates may be slightly higher, but even <em>twice</em> this rate would still place Cuba far below the regional average (and <em>far</em> lower than under Batista).</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.globalhungerindex.org/cuba.html">2019 Global Hunger Index</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[7]" title="press 7 to open link"></span>, Cuba is one of only seventeen nations on Earth (and only four in Latin America) to have a score lower than 5, signifying impressively low levels of hunger. Cuba's rate of undernourishment is below 2.5%.</p>

      <p>According to a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/malnutrition-death-rates?tab=chart&amp;country=CUB+USA">report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[8]" title="press 8 to open link"></span> from Our World in Data (based at the University of Oxford), Americans are more than twice as likely as Cubans to die from malnutrition.</p>

      <p>According to a <a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/agn/nutrition/cub_en.stm">report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[9]" title="press 9 to open link"></span> from the FAO, "remarkably low percentages of child malnutrition put Cuba at the forefront of developing countries."</p>

      <p>According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131105150934/http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/cuba/CubaSituation0308.pdf">report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[10]" title="press 0 to open link"></span> from the United States Department of Agriculture, the average Cuban consumes approx. 3300 calories per day, far above the Latin American and Caribbean average, and only slightly lower than in the United States. Approx. 2/3 of nutritional needs are met by monthly food rations, while the rest is bought independently. The report also states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Cuban economy has made remarkable progress toward recovery from the economic disaster generated by the collapse of the Soviet Bloc.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>In its <a href="https://www1.wfp.org/countries/cuba">report on Cuba</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[11]" title="press . then 11 and Enter to open link"></span>, the World Food Program (the food-assistance branch of the United Nations) states that that:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Over the last 50 years, comprehensive social protection programs have largely eradicated poverty and hunger. Food-based social safety nets include a monthly food basket for the entire population, school feeding programs, and mother-and-child health care programs.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This is especially impressive when Cuba is compared to other developing countries, and considering the decades of economic blockade that the nation has endured. The report also states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The largest island in the Caribbean, Cuba ranks 72th out of 189 countries in the 2019 Human Development Index and is one of the most successful in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/sep/30/millennium-development-goals-cuba">article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[12]" title="press . then 12 and Enter to open link"></span> in the <em>Guardian</em> addresses this topic:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>...the evidence suggests that Cuba has made excellent progress towards the MDGs in the last decade, building on what are already universally acknowledged to be outstanding achievements in equitable health and education standards.  </p>

        <p>According to a new MDG Report Card by the Overseas Development Institute, Cuba is among the 20 best performing countries in the world.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The article also includes a statement from a Cuban economist on how this progress is made:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Cuban economy is planned and we redistribute income from the most dynamic sectors, which generate most foreign exchange, towards those that are less dynamic but necessary for the country. That's how we maintain a budget to keep health and education high quality and free of charge to the user.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The revolution greatly improved the housing situation in Cuba, and also brought significant urban development. According to Oxfam America:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Initiatives in the cities were no less ambitious. Urban reform brought a halving of rents for Cuban tenants, opportunities for tenants to own their housing, and an ambitious program of housing construction for those living in marginal shantytowns. New housing, along with the implementation of measures to create jobs and reduce unemployment, especially among women, rapidly transformed the former shantytowns.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Finally, the social security and pensions system in Cuba has drastically improved since the revolution, as evidenced by this statement from the aforementioned Oxfam America report:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Both coverage and distribution have improved significantly since the revolution. With a pension system since the 1930's, Cuba was one of the first Latin American countries to establish one. It consisted of independent pension funds and by 1959 covered about 63% of workers, but the system varied greatly in terms of benefits and relied almost exclusively on workers' contributions. Since 1959, the program has been funded completely by the government. In 1958, about 63% of the labor force was covered for old age, disability, and survivors insurance; today, the coverage is universal.</p>

      <p><strong>Sustainable Development and Environmental Preservation</strong></p>

      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919303386">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[13]" title="press . then 13 and Enter to open link"></span> in the journal <em>Ecological Economics,</em> Cuba is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinero/2019/12/01/every-country-is-developing-according-to-the-new-sustainable-development-index/#4ce6dd7618bc">the most sustainably developed country in the world</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[14]" title="press . then 14 and Enter to open link"></span>. This is based on the <a href="https://www.sustainabledevelopmentindex.org/">Sustainable Development Index</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[15]" title="press . then 15 and Enter to open link"></span>, which measures a nation's human development outcomes (health and education, per-capita income, etc.) and factors in the country's environmental impact. This result was confirmed in a separate <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/As-World-Burns-Cuba-Number-1-for-Sustainable-Development-WWF-20161027-0018.html">report from the World Wildlife Fund</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[16]" title="press . then 16 and Enter to open link"></span>.</p>

      <p>Cuba is also <a href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/2015/09/23/eight-countries-meet-two-key-conditions-sustainable-development-united-nations-adopts-sustainable-development-goals/">one of the only nations to meet conditions for sustainable development</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[17]" title="press . then 17 and Enter to open link"></span>, and has been <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?1944/the-other-cuban-revolution">praised by the WWF</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[18]" title="press . then 18 and Enter to open link"></span> for its "enlightened environmental policies." Considering the increasingly urgent threat posed by climate change and environmental catastrophe, Cuba provides a model for the rest of the world to aspire to.</p>

      <p><strong>Healthcare Indicators</strong></p>

      <p>Cuba's healthcare system is one of its most impressive and well-known achievements. According to the aforementioned <a href="https://www.coralgablescavaliers.org/ourpages/users/099346/IB%20History/Americas/Cuba/Cuba_s%20Food%20Rationing.pdf">paper</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[19]" title="press . then 19 and Enter to open link"></span> from Cornell University:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Cuba’s superior health indicators—highly ranked both regionally and globally—are attributed to the country’s universal primary healthcare services.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The Cuban health system is based on public investment and universal provision. According to a <a href="http://www.ecocubanetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/NASW%20CUBA%20REPORT.pdf">report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[20]" title="press . then 20 and Enter to open link"></span> from the National Association of Social Workers:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Cuba has the largest number of doctors per capita of any country in the world... the country devotes almost a quarter of its gross domestic product (GDP) to education  and health care—nearly twice the percentage of U.S. GDP allotted to the same expenses. As a result, the country guarantees free education and health care for all citizens, and women receive six weeks of paid prenatal maternity leave and up to one year of paid leave after giving birth.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>According to <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?locations=CU-US">data</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[21]" title="press . then 21 and Enter to open link"></span> from the World Bank, Cuba's life expectancy is slightly <em>longer</em> than that of the United States. Compare this to the pre-revolutionary era, when the Cuban life expectancy was approximately six years shorter than the American life expectancy.</p>

      <p>Also, according to <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN?locations=CU-US">data</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[22]" title="press . then 22 and Enter to open link"></span> from the World Bank, Cuba's infant mortality rate is approximately one-third <em>lower</em> than that of the United States. Compare this to the pre-revolutionary era, when the Cuban infant mortality rate was nearly <em>double</em> that of the USA.</p>

      <p>According to a 2019 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0169796X19826731">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[23]" title="press . then 23 and Enter to open link"></span> published in the <em>Journal of Developing Societies</em>, Cuba's health indicators surpass those of developed nations, despite far lower expenditures:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>While Cuba spends about one-twentieth per capita on healthcare compared to the USA... people in Cuba nevertheless enjoy longer life expectancy (79 years) than do people in the USA (78 years)... Cuba also has a superior childhood mortality rate (the number of deaths to age 5 per 1,000 live births per year) of six, compared to eight in the USA.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Cuba has also made some amazing healthcare developments. According to the WHO, <a href="https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/mtct-hiv-cuba/en/">Cuba is the first nation in the world to eliminate mother-to-child HIV and syphilis transmission</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[24]" title="press . then 24 and Enter to open link"></span>.</p>

      <p>According to the <em>Washington Post</em>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/10/27/in-a-first-u-s-trial-to-test-cuban-lung-cancer-vaccine/?utm_term=.9a6205587548">Cuba has developed a potential vaccine against lung cancer</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[25]" title="press . then 25 and Enter to open link"></span>, which has shown very promising results, and is being tested in the USA.</p>

      <p>The Cuban experience provides an important model for other nations to follow. According to a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/35/4/817/686547">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[26]" title="press . then 26 and Enter to open link"></span> in the <em>International Journal of Epidemiology</em> (published by the Oxford University Press):</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Cuba represents an important alternative example where modest infrastructure investments combined with a well-developed public health strategy have generated health status measures comparable with those of industrialized countries... If the Cuban experience were generalized to other poor and middle-income countries human health would be transformed.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/jul/17/internationalnews">article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[27]" title="press . then 27 and Enter to open link"></span> in the <em>Guardian</em> summarizes this topic quite well:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Whether it is a consultation, dentures or open heart surgery, citizens are entitled to free treatment. As a result the impoverished island boasts better health indicators than its exponentially richer neighbour 90 miles across the Florida straits.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This is an enormously impressive achievement.</p>

      <p><strong>Educational Developments</strong></p>

      <p>Since the revolution, enormous strides have been made in education. One of the most significant developments was the National Literacy Campaign, spearheaded by Che Guevara. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090303221405/http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/OA-Cuba_Social_Policy_at_Crossroads-en.pdf">Oxfam America</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[28]" title="press . then 28 and Enter to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The National Literacy Campaign of 1961, recognized as one of the most successful initiatives of its kind, mobilized teachers, workers, and secondary school students to teach more than 700,000 persons how to read. This campaign reduced the illiteracy rate from 23% to 4% in the space of one year.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Before the revolution, literacy in Cuba was between 60% and 76%, depending on the estimates used. Today, the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html">CIA World Factbook</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[29]" title="press . then 29 and Enter to open link"></span> gives Cuba's literacy rate as 99.8%.</p>

      <p>In addition, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/369rank.html#CU">Cuba spends a higher percentage of GDP on education than any other nation in the world</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[30]" title="press . then 30 and Enter to open link"></span>. This has resulted in impressive results; according to a 2014 <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/LAC/Great_Teachers-How_to_Raise_Student_Learning-Barbara-Bruns-Advance%20Edition.pdf">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[31]" title="press . then 31 and Enter to open link"></span> from the World Bank, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/world-bank-cuba-has-the-b_b_5925864">Cuba has the only "high quality" educational system in Latin America</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[32]" title="press . then 32 and Enter to open link"></span>.</p>

      <p><strong>Infrastructural Developments</strong></p>

      <p>In 1959, approx. 50% of Cuban households had access to electricity. According to <a href="https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/cuban-electric-grid.pdf">a report from the Environmental Defense Fund</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[33]" title="press . then 33 and Enter to open link"></span>, by 1989, more than 95% of households had access to electricity, including in rural areas, which had previously been almost entirely deprived. Cuba also surpassed many of its neighbors in terms of electricity generation:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>By 1990 Cuba had roughly 1.8 times more generating capacity per person than the Dominican Republic and 1.3 times more than Jamaica.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>In Cuba, <a href="http://data.un.org/en/iso/cu.html">access to clean water and sanitation has greatly improved since the revolution</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[34]" title="press . then 34 and Enter to open link"></span>. According to United Nations data, as of 2018, 96.4% of the urban population and 89.8% of the rural population had access to clean drinking water, while 94.4% of the urban population and 89.1% of the rural population had access to improved sanitation services:</p>

      <p>An excellent <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/fidel-castro-death-cuba-embargo-peasants-poor-urban-areas-modernisation-a7441036.html">article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[35]" title="press . then 35 and Enter to open link"></span> in the <em>Independent</em> discussed this issue quite well:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>This is Fidel’s legacy. Clean water and electricity for all. And universal free education and healthcare. Cubans often joke that they’re healthier and better educated than Americans despite the 50-year-plus US blockade.  </p>

        <p>So for me, rural Cuba is Fidel’s Cuba. His ideals live on here – and the rural poor of Cuba have benefited the most from his cradle-to-grave policies. Here, the grandchildren of peasants really do go on to become consultant surgeons and commercial airline pilots.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This is an enormous credit to the revolution.</p>

      <p><strong>Social Policy</strong></p>

      <p>The Cuban revolution has also made great strides in eliminating discrimination and inequality. As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090303221405/http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/OA-Cuba_Social_Policy_at_Crossroads-en.pdf">report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[36]" title="press . then 36 and Enter to open link"></span> from Oxfam America states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Social policy has also favored the development of equity across society, including the equitable distribution of benefits across all sectors of the population, sometimes favoring the most vulnerable. In the last 40 years Cubans have greatly reduced differences in income between the lowest and the highest paid persons. Women have benefited significantly from the revolution as they have educated themselves and entered the labor force in large numbers. The differences among Cubans of different races have also been reduced.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Considering the widespread racial and gender discrimination that existed before the revolution, these achievements must be admired.</p>

      <p><strong>Popular Opinion in Cuba</strong></p>

      <p>According to an <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/121502/cuban-poll-shows-more-political-satisfaction-americans">article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[37]" title="press . then 37 and Enter to open link"></span> published in the <em>New Republic</em>, Cubans are significantly more satisfied with their political system than Americans are with theirs. The same holds true for the healthcare and education systems:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>More than two-thirds of Cubans—68 percent—are satisfied with their health care system. About 66 percent of Americans said the same in a November 2014 Gallup poll. Seventy-two percent of Cubans are satisfied with their education system, while an August 2014 Gallup poll found that less than half of Americans—48 percent—are “completely” or “somewhat” satisfied with the quality of K-12 education.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The Cuban people also recently ratified a new constitution, which reasserts the role of the Communist Party, and affirms that Cuba is a socialist state advancing towards communism. The constitution also includes some political and economic reforms, such as the recognition of small businesses, and the presumption of innocence in the court system. According to an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-constitution-referendum-idUSKCN1QE22Y">article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[38]" title="press . then 38 and Enter to open link"></span> from Reuters, independent evidence supports the official vote tally (approx. 90% support):</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The independent online newspaper <em>El Toque</em> asked readers to send in local tallies, a dozen of which showed overwhelming support for ratification.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Yoani Sanchez, "Cuba's best-known dissident," witnessed the count at her local polling station, reporting the results as "400 yes votes, 25 no votes and 4 blank ballots." This suggests that the official results were correct, and the Cuban people did overwhelmingly support the new constitution.</p>

      <p>An <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/fidel-castro-death-cuba-embargo-peasants-poor-urban-areas-modernisation-a7441036.html">article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[39]" title="press . then 39 and Enter to open link"></span> in the <em>Independent</em>, written by an author whose family lives in Cuba, sums this issue up well:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Most Cubans I speak to support the reshaping of the economy and the greater ties with the US. Just like us, they want to better their lives, they want a better mobile phone, a bigger house, they want to travel. But none of them would want to live in a Cuba, no matter how rich, without universal free education, free healthcare, cheap public transport and the lowest rates of violent crime in the Americas. None of them. This is Fidel's legacy.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>While the Cuban people largely support economic reform and normalization of relations with the USA, their overall support for the achievements of their socialist system remains high. As the <em>New Republic</em> puts it:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Objective indicators, like the country's low infant mortality and illiteracy rates, have long shown that Cuba has relatively strong social services. This new polling data suggests that Cubans are well aware of it.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This is an important credit to the revolution.</p>

      <p><strong>"But What About the Cuban Exiles?"</strong></p>

      <p>The most common argument against Cuban socialism is that the Cuban exile population (and their strong distaste for socialism) somehow "proves" that socialist Cuba is terrible. However, this omits a key fact: the exiles come primarily from the wealthy class of Cuba. According to a  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/799194?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">study</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[40]" title="press . then 40 and Enter to open link"></span> in the journal <em>Social Problems</em> (published by the Oxford University Press):</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Comparison of the occupational, age, and educational composition of the community with the Cuban population indicates that the refugees are better educated and come from higher status occupations than the population from which they have exiled themselves... more recent exiles are more representative of the Cuban population, but the rural worker is still vastly underrepresented.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Another thing to consider is that the exile took place during a time of conflict and difficulty for Cuba; the revolution was still very new, and the government had not entirely established itself yet. This likely explains why there were some outliers (i.e. exiles from the working-class population), although the majority were still from the wealthy sectors of Cuban society.</p>

      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

      <p>Cuba is a nation with many problems; the economy has slowed since the fall of the Soviet Union (losing your only major trading partner tends to hurt a nation's economy), and international pressure from the USA continues to place Cuba under strain. However, the enormous achievements of the revolution cannot be overlooked; Cuba has provided first-world health and educational standards on a third-world budget, as well as above-average nutrition and infrastructure, all while standing up to the world's most powerful imperialist force, only ninety miles off its shores.</p>

      <p>One struggles to find a proper statement with which to sum up the achievements of the Cuban revolution. Perhaps this one, from former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan (from April 11, 2000):</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Cuba’s achievements in social development are impressive given the size of its gross domestic product per capita. As the human development index of the United Nations makes clear year after year, Cuba should be the envy of many other nations, ostensibly far richer. [Cuba] demonstrates how much nations can do with the resources they have if they focus on the right priorities – health, education, and literacy.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Perhaps the best statement is given by Aviva Chomsky in her book <a href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4447044/mod_resource/content/1/A-History-of-the-Cuban-Revolution.pdf">A History of the Cuban Revolution</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[41]" title="press . then 41 and Enter to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Revolution has been wildly audacious, experimental, and diverse. It has evolved under often adverse circumstances. It created unprecedented socioeconomic equality, and showed the world that it is indeed possible for a poor, Third World country to feed, educate, and provide health care for its population... If we want to imagine a better world for all of us, I can think of no better place to start than by studying the Cuban Revolution.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>That's something which we can all appreciate.</p>
