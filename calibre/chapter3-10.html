      <p>I would like to begin with a quote by Joseph Stalin.</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>"Officers and men of the Red Army! We are entering the country of the enemy. The remaining population in the liberated areas, regardless of whether they’re German, Czech, or Polish, should not be subjected to violence. The perpetrators will be punished according to the laws of war. In the liberated territories, sexual relations with females are not allowed. Perpetrators of violence and rape will be shot.” - J.V. Stalin, Order of the Day, January 19, 1945.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>That is a direct quote from Stalin which you can easily find. But of course it is even easier to find western propaganda.</p>

      <p>Another quote from the book Browder &amp; Kerensky, 1961.</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>However, four months later, on July 12th of 1917, the death penalty was restored for all military crimes, murder, rape, and offences against the state committed during war time (Browder &amp; Kerensky, 1961). This measure was adopted by the Provisional government as a result of the deteriorating political and economic situation in Russia due to its unsuccessful participation in WWI and associated civil disturbances</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>After the war Soviet officers began mass executing thousands of their own soldiers. The reason? War rape. Almost all Russian WW2 historians support this. One such example is Oleg Rzheshevky.</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>According to Oleg Rzheshevsky, a President of the Russian Association of World War II Historians, 4,148 Red Army officers and many soldiers were convicted of atrocities and punished with capital punishment, while only 69 U.S. soldiers were executed. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>And</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Makhmut Gareev states that he had not even heard about sexual violence. He says that "instances of cruelty, including sexual, occurred", and that they "simply could not be absent after what the Nazis did" in the USSR, but also states that "such cases were strongly suppressed and punished," and that "they did not become widespread." He notes that the Soviet military leadership signed an executive order on 19 January 1945 that demanded the prevention of cruel treatment of the local population.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Now this <a href="http://www.trud.ru/article/21-07-2005/90824_nasilie_nad_faktami/print/">article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span> is perfect for what you are looking for. (Google translate works better than expected.) And will be the primary source I will be quoting. (Although I will also be posting the name of books I am quoting in brackets.) That is also the source for the Oleg Rzheshevsky comment. </p>

      <p>The myth that Stalin and other high ranking officials at the time ordered the mass rape of civilians of any nation is not only entirely wrong but also had 2 primary origins and one secondary. The two primary origins were Anthony Bivor and goebbels. Goebbels began the myth that the red army was so ruthless and ravenous that they would rape any woman aged 10-70. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>"In all villages and cities, all German women aged 10 to 70 were subjected to countless rapes. the behavior of a Soviet soldier can be seen as an explicit system."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This was where the rape of millions myth began. His evidence for the rapes themselves began with him using one unidentified rape as a way to mobilize civilians to rise against the, and I quote, "Russian Mongol savages." Sadly I no longer have a source for that last part. (as the link I used to use no longer works) Also notice the statement of "The behavior of the Soviet soldiers can be seen as an explicit system." Direct propaganda.</p>

      <p>Anthony took this a step further.</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>However, Bivor surpassed Goebbels. Without any documentary evidence or at least non-anonymous testimony, he states: "According to the estimates of the two main Berlin hospitals, the number of raped Soviet soldiers ranges from 95 to 130 thousand people."One doctor concluded that only in Berlin some 100,000 women were raped ... Apparently, much more if you take into account the 1 million 400 thousand raped in East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia. It seems that about two million German women were raped."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>With no evidence he claimed two million people were raped. TWO MILLION... He is one of the primary source for all western historians... To give you an idea of their validity. He is basically the big black book of Communism but for the Red army.</p>

      <p>Now the secondary source is the book and individual who started the myth that Stalin told his soldiers to start raping. The book and individual in question are, "Conversations with Stalin" by Milovan Djilas. The book was what first stated that Stalin and other officials ordered the rape of civilians. (The book itself being as factual as the black book)</p>

      <p>Now to give you an idea of how trustworthy Milovan is, he hated and slandered Stalin any chance he got. He felt that khrushchev was a far smarter, cunning, intelligent, and capable leader. And also has a book praising Gorbachev to the point of claiming he was not only a great leader, but he did the right thing.</p>

      <p>With all that in mind we can come to a few conclusions. </p>

      <ol>

        <li>

          <p>Stalin and the high ranking officials were not only against ANY form of harm against the civilians, but also ordered the execution of any soldiers who would commit such acts. I mean consider how big Stalin and the Soviet government were on women's rights? Do you honestly think they would allow or order the rape of women and children? No.</p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>The numbers were not in the millions, or even hundred thousands, but we're definitely in the tens of thousands. Most likely less than a hundred thousand. </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>Almost all of the sources that western historians based their findings on cannot be trusted. And have histories of attempting to slander the red army and Soviet Union. Attempting to make them look like savages. I mean, just look at all the propaganda against the Red army. They supposedly mass raped everything that moved, fought without weapons, shot deserters, only fought because they would be shot, constantly committed war crimes and atrocities, were undisciplined, only won because of lend lease, (even though they only used about 10% of it) and won by just throwing soldiers at the enemy until they overwhelmed them.... Right all sounds believable. So no none of it is trustworthy. Also note how the Red army was supposedly ravenous savages while amerkian soldiers woo German woman with just chocolate. This is no accident, the wooing with chocolate was frequently <em>less than consensual.</em> (There is a large amount of evidence of mass rape by U$ soldiers)</p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>The rapists got what they deserved and were shot by the thousands.</p>

        </li>

      </ol>

      <p>Now do not mistake what I am saying as justification or defence of the rapists in the Red army. Or denial that any rapes even happened. No they were monsters and deserved to be shot and the rapes definitely did happen. But it was only a few thousand soldiers committing these acts and the majority were shot. And every last one of them deserved a bullet, to be hung, some probably even torture. And the majority got it. So please do not mistake this as apologia. (I had someone accuse me of it once hence this whole paragraph.)</p>

      <p>Now as a little bonus I will give you a prime example of the trustworthiness and hypocrisy of western historians.</p>

      <p>The mass rape of Japanese civilians by amerikan soldiers. This will be the <a href="http://uncensoredhistory.blogspot.com/2012/10/rape-abuse-japanese-women-american-soldiers.html?m=1">article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span> I am referencing.
The article itself is well sourced. Although it also spews propaganda about the Soviet union (taking a centrist, everyone is equally terrible and the Soviets were just as bad as the Nazis perspective) it is still a great article.</p>

      <p>Now shortly after the occupation of Japan mass rape by U$ soldiers was so rampant that after 10 days they stopped keeping count. (and began to cover it up, which can be read in the article I linked) In fact,</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>There were also 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of Kanagawa prefecture after the Japanese surrender. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Just one prefecture in 10 days. Yet the western historian numbers for the entire country (when they are actually willing to admit rape happened) is never higher than ten thousand. Although they frequently deny that any rapes happened. (Unlike the Soviet and Russian historians that admit that some of their soldiers did commit these acts.) Even though it is well documented with actual credible resources. On top of that the U$ actually did sanction the rape of civilians (also in the article I linked) in both allowing the rape of them, and working with the emperor to have forced comfort women ready for the U$ soldiers. Also only 3 individuals were ever tried for rape, all 3 were black. (As opposed to the 4000-5000 Soviet soldiers who were tried and executed.)  They also silenced any Japanese civilians who attempted to oppose their crimes and made it illegal to write newspapers or comment against their occupation or the bombs until 1952.</p>

      <p>There is more but this is already a wall of text so I will stop for now. But you should also look into the rape of Germany by U$ soldiers. The amerikans worked hard to try and cover up their crimes and worked with the former Nazis to make the Red army out to be savages while their own soldiers were heroes. Their soldiers also mass raped likely far more.</p>

      <p>I hope this helped comrade and was what you were looking for. Also sorry for the wall of text. And I am not sure about the NKVD committing atrocities (that sounds like western propaganda.) But then again, I do not know as much about the subject. Still though, I would be suspicious of such claims.</p>

      <p>Well that was super depressing to write about so I am probably going to lie down for awhile.</p>

      <p>I will finish this with one final significant quote. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>This war was started against us not by the German people, not by German workers, peasants, and intelligentsia, who's suffering we all understand, but by the gang of bloodthirsty fascist rulers of Germany, who have enslaved French, Czechs, Poles, Serbs, Norwegians, Belgians, Danes, Dutch, Greeks, and other peoples.  V. M. Molotov, 1941</p>
