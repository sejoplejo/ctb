      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

      <p>Hello comrades. Normally our masterposts deal with entire nations or recent events, but seeing as this particular topic is one of the most discussed in online political circles, it seems deserving of its own discussion. This is especially true because this topic often acts as a barrier to those who wish to learn more about communism, and Marxism-Leninism in particular.</p>

      <p>In order to deal with this topic, I decided to put together a discussion of Joseph Stalin from a Marxist-Leninist perspective. In it, we will deal with Stalin's successes and failures, correct various misconceptions and falsehoods surrounding him, and place the man in his proper historical context.</p>

      <p>It should also be said, this discussion will not gloss over and/or ignore Stalin's various flaws and misdoings; "Stalin did nothing wrong" is a good meme, but it's a bad analysis.</p>

      <p>As always, all sources will be listed at the end of the post.</p>

      <p><strong>The Soviet Economy Under Stalin</strong></p>

      <p>It is commonly alleged that Stalin presided over a period of economic failure in the USSR, due to his insistence upon industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture. However, more recent research has painted a far more positive picture.</p>

      <p>According to Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.ae/citations?user=o-1ldbkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Robert Allen</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Soviet economy performed well... Planning led to high rates of capital accumulation, rapid GDP growth, and rising per capita consumption even in the 1930's. [...] The expansion of heavy industry and the use of output targets and soft-budgets to direct firms were appropriate to the conditions of the 1930's, they were adopted quickly, and they led to rapid growth of investment and consumption.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Professor <a href="http://www.ebrainerd.com/">Elizabeth Brainerd</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span> refers to Soviet growth rates as "impressive," noting that they "promoted the rapid industrialization of the USSR, particularly in the decades from the 1930's to the 1960's." She also states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Both Western and Soviet estimates of GNP growth in the Soviet Union indicate that GNP per capita grew in every decade in the postwar era, at times far surpassing the growth rates of the developed western economies.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Even still, it is often claimed that this growth did not improve the standard of living for the Soviet people. However, more recent research has also shown this to be false.</p>

      <p>According to Professor Allen:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>While investment certainly increased rapidly, recent research shows that the standard of living also increased briskly. [...] Calories are the most basic dimension of the standard of living, and their consumption was higher in the late 1930's than in the 1920's. [...] There has been no debate that ‘collective consumption’ (principally education and health services) rose sharply, but the standard view was that private consumption declined. Recent research, however, calls that conclusion into question... Consumption per head rose about one quarter between 1928 and the late 1930's.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>According to Professor Brainerd:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The conventional measures of GNP growth and household consumption indicate a long, uninterrupted upward climb in the Soviet standard of living from 1928 to 1985; even Western estimates of these measures support this view, albeit at a slower rate of growth than the Soviet measures.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>While the economy is not the main purpose of this discussion, it should be acknowledged that under Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union experienced rapid economic growth, and a significant increase in the population's standard of living.</p>

      <p><strong>The Great Purge</strong></p>

      <p>The purges of the late-1930's are a definite black mark on the legacy of Soviet socialism; this much cannot be denied. That being said, they have been the subject of decades-worth of unjustified and intolerable distortions and exaggerations by bourgeois academics, necessitating a thorough reply.</p>

      <p>Firstly, let us establish the facts of how many people actually died in the purges. While Westerners are often treated to numbers ranging from 20 to 50 million, the true figures (while bad enough in their own right) are nowhere near that high. According to Professor <a href="https://history.ucla.edu/faculty/j-arch-getty">J. Arch Getty</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>From 1921 to Stalin's death, in 1953, around 800,000 people were sentenced to death and shot, 85 percent of them in the years of the Great Terror of 1937-1938. From 1934 to Stalin's death, more than a million perished in the gulag camps.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>To these figures must be added an important qualification: contrary to popular opinion, the vast majority of gulag inmates were not innocent political prisoners. Professor Getty notes that those convicted of "counterrevolutionary crimes" made up between 12 and 33 percent (depending on the year) of the gulag population, with the rest having been convicted of ordinary crimes. He also rejects the common claim that non-Russian nationalities were disproportionately targeted. To quote from his article in the <em>American Historical Review:</em></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The long-awaited archival evidence on repression in the period of the Great Purges shows that the levels of arrests, political prisoners, executions, and general camp populations tend to confirm the orders of magnitude indicated by those labeled as "revisionists" and mocked by those proposing high estimates... inferences that the terror fell particularly hard on non-Russian nationalities are not borne out by the camp population data from the 1930's. The frequent assertion that most of the camp prisoners were 'political' also seems not to be true.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>In addition, the gulags were not death camps like those of the Nazis; they were prisons, albeit harsh ones. Even noted anti-communist scholars (such as those who worked on the infamous <em>Black Book of Communism</em>) have admitted this. To quote again from Professor Getty:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Stalin's camps were different from Hitler's. Tens of thousands of prisoners were released every year upon completion of their sentences. We now know that before World War II more inmates escaped annually from the Soviet camps than died there. [...]  Werth, a well-regarded French specialist on the Soviet Union whose sections in the <em>Black Book</em> on the Soviet Communists are sober and damning, told <em>Le Monde,</em> "Death camps did not exist in the Soviet Union."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>It must also be noted that, contrary to the popular conception of Stalin's USSR as a place of "total terror" (to quote Hannah Arendt), the majority of the population did not feel threatened by the purges. Referring to the time of the Great Purge, Professor <a href="http://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/history/about/faculty/emeriti-faculty/thurston/index.html">Robert Thurston</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span> notes that "my evidence suggests that widespread fear did not exist in the case at hand." He also notes that the Great Purge was an exceptional occurrence, which cannot be used to characterize the Stalinist-era as a whole:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>I will not simply imply but will state outright that the <em>Ezhovshchina</em> [Great Purge] was an aberration. Torture was uncommon until August 1937, when it became the norm; it ended abruptly with Beria's rise to head of the NKVD in late 1938. Mass arrests followed the same pattern... A campaign for more regular, fair, and systemic judicial procedures that began in 1933-1934 was interrupted and overwhelmed by the Terror in 1937. It resumed in the spring of 1938, more strongly and effectively than before. Thus more than one trend was broken by the <em>Ezhovshchina</em>, only to reappear after it.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>He also points out that some arrests which took place during the Great Purge were based on previously-ignored (yet arguably still legitimate) crimes against the Soviet state, such as fighting with the reactionary forces during the Civil War:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>People were suddenly arrested in 1937 for things that had happened many years earlier but had been ignored since, for example, serving in a White army.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The question arises: why arrest former White Army soldiers, among others? The answer lies in the general fear of counterrevolution which pervaded the party at this time. According to Professor <a href="https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/history/staff/64/professor-james-harris">James Harris</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5]" title="press 5 to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>By the mid-1930's, the rise of the Nazis in Germany and the militarists in Japan, both stridently anti-communist, posed a very real threat to the USSR. War was then on the horizon, and Stalin felt he had no choice but to take preemptive action against what he saw as a potential fifth column – a group that would undermine the larger collective.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Remember that since the moment of its founding (still a recent event, at this time), the Soviet Union had been <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-i/the-day-that-the-usa-invaded-russia-and-fought-with-the-red-army-x.html">invaded by multiple capitalist powers</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span> (including the United States) in the early-1920's, and had also been subject to espionage and internal sabotage. Combined with the looming threat of war with an increasingly powerful Nazi Germany, it is hardly surprising that these factors came together to form an atmosphere of paranoia, which lent itself to the sort of violent excess seen during the Purge. This coincides with Professor Thurston's interpretation of the events, from his book <em>Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia:</em></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>...between 1934 and 1936 police and court practice relaxed significantly. Then a series of events, together with the tense international situation and memories of real enemy activity during the savage Russian Civil War, combined to push leaders and people into a hysterical hunt for perceived 'wreckers.' After late 1938, however, the police and courts became dramatically milder.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This general atmosphere of fear (not of the purges, but of external and internal enemies) is most likely why the majority of the Soviet people seemed to support the government's actions during the Purge period. According to Professor Thurston:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The various reactions to arrest cataloged above suggest that general fear did not exist in the USSR at any time in the late 1930's... People who remained at liberty often felt that some event in the backgrounds of the detained individuals justified their arrests. The sense that anyone could be next, the underpinning of theoretical systems of terror, rarely appears.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Overall, perhaps the most succinct summary of this issue is the one provided in Professor Thurston's book, in which he states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>There was never a long period of Stalinism without a serious foreign threat, major internal dislocation, or both, which makes identifying its true nature impossible.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>As Marxists, we should be well aware that material conditions shape ideological and political structures. The savagery of the Russian Civil War, the multiple invasions from capitalist powers, and the increasing threat of a war against fascism make the paranoid atmosphere of the late-1930's understandable, if not condonable; yet even while we discuss the genuine causes of the Purge, and reject the hysterical anti-communist mud-throwing of the Cold Warriors, we must still acknowledge the black mark that the Purge leaves on Stalin's legacy.</p>

      <p><strong>The Ukrainian Famine ("Holodomor")</strong></p>

      <p>Perhaps the most pernicious accusation against Stalin is that he orchestrated the dreadful famine of the early-1930's in order to squash a Ukrainian nationalist revolt. This despicable slander (which is peddled largely by Ukrainian nationalist and neo-fascist groups) is easily refuted by examining the historical consensus. The following quotes are compiled in an article from the <em>Village Voice</em>, cited below.</p>

      <p><a href="https://creees.stanford.edu/events/alexander-dallin-lecture-russian-east-european-and-eurasian-affairs">Alexander Dallin</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[7]" title="press 7 to open link"></span> of Stanford University writes:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>There is no evidence it was intentionally directed against Ukrainians... that would be totally out of keeping with what we know -- it makes no sense.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><a href="https://www.upenn.edu/emeritus/memoriam/Lewin.html">Moshe Lewin</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[8]" title="press 8 to open link"></span> of the University of Pennsylvania stated:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>This is crap, rubbish... I am an anti-Stalinist, but I don't see how this [genocide] campaign adds to our knowledge. It's adding horrors, adding horrors, until it becomes a pathology.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><a href="https://history.utoronto.ca/people/lynne-viola">Lynne Viola</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[9]" title="press 9 to open link"></span> of the University of Toronto writes:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>I absolutely reject it... Why in god's name would this paranoid government consciously produce a famine when they were terrified of war [with Germany]?</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><a href="https://history.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty/mark-b-tauger">Mark Tauger</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[10]" title="press 0 to open link"></span>, Professor of History at West Virginia University (reviewing work by <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/individuals/professor-stephen-wheatcroft">Stephen Wheatcroft</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[11]" title="press . then 11 and Enter to open link"></span> and <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gov/davies-bob.aspx">R.W. Davies</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[12]" title="press . then 12 and Enter to open link"></span>) has this to say:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Popular media and most historians for decades have described the great famine that struck most of the USSR in the early 1930s as “man-made,” very often even a “genocide” that Stalin perpetrated intentionally against Ukrainians and sometimes other national groups to destroy them as nations... This perspective, however, is wrong. The famine that took place was not limited to Ukraine or even to rural areas of the USSR, it was not fundamentally or exclusively man-made, and it was far from the intention of Stalin and others in the Soviet leadership to create such as disaster. A small but growing literature relying on new archival documents and a critical approach to other sources has shown the flaws in the “genocide” or “intentionalist” interpretation of the famine and has developed an alternative interpretation.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>More recent research has discovered natural causes for the Ukrainian famine. Tauger notes:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>...the USSR experienced an unusual environmental disaster in 1932: extremely wet and humid weather that gave rise to severe plant disease infestations, especially rust. Ukraine had double or triple the normal rainfall in 1932. Both the weather conditions and the rust spread from Eastern Europe, as plant pathologists at the time documented. Soviet plant pathologists in particular estimated that rust and other fungal diseases reduced the potential harvest in 1932 by almost nine million tons, which is the largest documented harvest loss from any single cause in Soviet history.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>It should be noted that this does not excuse the Soviet state from any and all responsibility for the suffering that took place; one could accuse the government of insufficiently rapid response, and note that initial reports were often downplayed to avoid rocking the boat. But it is clear that the famine was not deliberate, was not a genocide, and (to quote Tauger) "was not fundamentally or exclusively man-made."</p>

      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

      <p>In short, comrades, Stalin was an extraordinarily complex man. His legacy is far too nuanced to be summed-up in catchphrases like "Stalin was worse than Hitler," or "Stalin did nothing wrong." He was a flawed leader, who managed some enormous achievements (rapid industrial and economic growth, improvements to the standard of living, leading the USSR to victory over Nazism), while also making some enormous mistakes (the paranoia of the purges, the errors of the famine, the rolling-back of progressive social policies).</p>

      <p>We should not respond to bourgeois propaganda by insisting (as some well-meaning yet mistaken comrades have done) that every single misdeed of Stalin is a lie; rather, we should place them into proper historical context, along with his various achievements. This is the correct way for Marxists to analyze the world: with a firm, well-grounded materialist critique, yielding no ground to hero worship, or to a fictitious "great man" theory of history. Recall what Fidel Castro said on the matter:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>I believe Stalin made big mistakes but also showed great wisdom. In my opinion, blaming Stalin for everything that occurred in the Soviet Union would be historical simplism, because no man by himself could have created certain conditions. It would be the same as giving Stalin all the credit for what the USSR once was. That is impossible! I believe that the efforts of millions and millions of heroic people contributed to the USSR's development and to its relevant role in the world in favor of hundreds of millions of people. [...] I think there should be an impartial analysis of Stalin. Blaming him for everything that happened would be historical simplism.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Stalin was a great proletarian revolutionary, and yet he was also a highly flawed leader. Do not be ashamed of this legacy, comrades; rather, recall that in all things, there is contradiction.</p>
