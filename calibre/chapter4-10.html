      <p>Hello to All Comrades.</p>

      <p>I have been researching this topic for a while. </p>

      <p>My interest was peaked by an article I saw in which the Dalai Lama, a man internationally renowned as a visionary, a kind, gentle honest man of integrity and peace, stated that <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20180912-dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-europeans">Europe belonged to the Europeans</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>A very fascistic statement from such an esteemed and highly respected figure, especially amongst the centrist and liberal communities. </p>

      <p>But this view shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, especially those with any semblance of knowledge about the Dalai Lama and the Buddhist kingdom he and his supporters claim he and his pre-destined regeneration, the Panchen Lama, are destined to rule forever. As well as his much-recognised friendship with actual Physical nazi Heinrich Harrer. </p>

      <p>First of all the notion that Buddhism is an inherently an eternally peaceful ideology is nonsense, as the rule of the Dalai Lama, henceforth DL, is slated for an end during the culmination of the current procession of the universal wheel, whereby a being will descend from Heaven and obliterate all non-believers, with an emphasis on Muslims, who it refers to as 'barbarians'. </p>

      <p>But this post is not about Buddhism at all, in fact, many comrades are Buddhist and I have the utmost love and respect for all comrades and acknowledge the power of religion in safeguarding the general status of individuals in times of crisis as well as their aversion to money and love of the poor. </p>

      <p>It is instead about the Dalai Lama, and his kingdom. </p>

      <p>Tibet is a region to the west of China that consists in its near entirety of white-tipped mountains forming the highest range in the world. Nestled in the highest regions of that range, is Lhasa, its capital. </p>

      <p>For a prominent portion of its history, Tibet was under Chinese rule, passing from emperor to emperor and witnessing varying levels of autonomy, until the Xinhai revolution in 1912.</p>

      <p>Before that, it experienced a minor rebellion in 1905 after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_Tibetan_Rebellion">Christian missionaries entered Tibet, seeking new converts. This rebellion was quickly crushed by the ruling Qing Dynasty</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button collapsed selftext" title="" data-host="wikipedia"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="wikipedia"></div></p>

      <p>It declared its independence in 1913, Citing vast ethnic and cultural differences. It also incorporated, without warning or witness, the province of Xikang into its territory, sparking the Sino-Tibetan war. Kuomintang official <a href="https://books.google.ie/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=tang+kesan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VH2uTNivA8P48AbSs8DqBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tang%20kesan&amp;f=false">Tang Kesan immediately sent about trying to work out an end to fighting</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>Other officials in the Kuomintang immediately broke the ceasefires, due to fear of political motivations from rivals. And they rapidly crushed the Tibetan forces.</p>

      <p><a href="https://books.google.ie/books?id=Nm5wAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ma+pu-fang+egypt&amp;dq=ma+pu-fang+egypt&amp;redir_esc=y">Over the next few years the Tibetans repeatedly attacked the Kuomintang forces, but were defeated several times.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span> In 1932 Tibet made the decision to expand the war into Qinghai against Muslim leader Ma Bufang, the reasons for which have speculated upon by many historians. My personal opinion is that they believed it would spark the war between the Buddhists and Muslims that would signal the arrival of the being from heaven who would vanquish all Non-believers. </p>

      <p>The Tibetans expanded to Yushu and Qinghai and now heavily outnumbered the local forces, numbering an estimated 3,000. Repeated Tibetan attacks were repulsed by the local Qinghai forces--even though they were as mentioned outnumbered--since the Tibetans were poorly prepared for war, and so they suffered heavier casualties than the Qinghai army.</p>

      <p>The Tibetan forces <a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt1qf0664z/qt1qf0664z.pdf">raped and murdered many nuns, locals, prisoners and invalid they could find, as well as embarked on a destructive campaign of looting and burning whole villages.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5]" title="press 5 to open link"></span> In return, the Qinghai forces executed Tibetan prisoners, burned monasteries, and had the civilians pay them for assisting Tibetans. </p>

      <p>A further regrouping of the Tibetans failed and they lost control of Xikang and were pushed by across the Jinsha river. There, several Tibetan generals surrendered, the Dalai Lama at the time <a href="https://books.google.ie/books?id=Q7MKAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Dalai+Lama+telegraphed+the+Government+of+India+asking+for+diplomatic+assistance&amp;q=Dalai+Lama+telegraphed+the+Government+of+India+asking+for+help&amp;redir_esc=y">demoted them</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>Losing so much territory in so little time caused the Tibetans to panic. They immediately asked the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24442792">British for assistance, in the form of funds, and arms which the British gave. The Indians gave some armaments as well.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[7]" title="press 7 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>By 1933, the Tibetans had suffered such historic defeats that<a href="https://books.google.ie/books?id=YD0sAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=ma+bufang+liu+wenhui&amp;q=ma+bufang&amp;redir_esc=y"> they negotiated a surrendered</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[8]" title="press 8 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>After the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war, the Communist party of China signed an agreement referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_Point_Agreement_for_the_Peaceful_Liberation_of_Tibet">the seventeen point agreement with the delegates of the Dalai Lama, who at this point, is the current Dalai Lama that you know well</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[9]" title="press 9 to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button collapsed selftext" title="" data-host="wikipedia"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="wikipedia"></div>, which eased Chinese territorial fears and gave Tibet autonomy.</p>

      <p>The DL sent a letter agreeing to the settlement: <a href="https://books.google.ie/books?id=WWjMMS7dHc0C&amp;pg=PT197&amp;lpg=PT197&amp;dq=%22The+Tibet+Local+Government+as+well+as+the+ecclesiastic+and+secular+people+unanimously+support+this+agreement,+and+under+the+leadership+of+Chairman+Mao+and+the+Central+People%27s+Government,+will+actively+support+the+People%27s+Liberation+Army+in+Tibet+to+consolidate+national+defence,+drive+out+imperialist+influences+from+Tibet+and+safeguard+the+unification+of+the+territory+and+the+sovereignty+of+the+Motherland.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3dgKXsZv21&amp;sig=P_Lu9SsN8ZdWg02mtFnPV37JDmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzm8PB6-XdAhXKJsAKHX07AJsQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ">""The Tibet Local Government as well as the ecclesiastic and secular people unanimously support this agreement, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, will actively support the People's Liberation Army in Tibet to consolidate national defence, drive out imperialist influences from Tibet and safeguard the unification of the territory and the sovereignty of the Motherland.""</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[10]" title="press 0 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>The Panchen Lama also agreed (Ibid.)</p>

      <p>The Tibetan government in exile refuses to acknowledge this signing and some of their older members who were delegates never signed the agreement. But the Tibetan national assembly asked the government to accept the agreement and <a href="http://www.tibet.net/en/index.php?id=183&amp;rmenuid=11">stated that it would send its own radio confirmation later</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[11]" title="press . then 11 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <p>Today, the Tibetan government in exile claims that the Chinese authorities at the meeting forced the Tibetans to sign and used forged Tibetan stamps whenever the Tibetans refused to sign. </p>

      <p>However, Melvyn Goldstein, who interviewed at least two negotiators and the only interpreter (the Dalai Lama's brother-in-law) from the Tibetan side states: <a href="http://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/297866">"The Chinese did make new seals for the Tibetans, but these were just personal seals with each delegate's name carved on them. Other than this, there were no forged government seals....In his autobiography, the Dalai Lama states that the Tibetan delegates claimed they were forced 'under duress' to sign the agreement...
Their feeling of duress derives from the general Chinese threat to use military force again in Central Tibet if an agreement was not concluded. However, according to international law, this does not invalidate an agreement. So long as there is no physical violence against the signatories, an agreement is valid....However, the deal requires full agreement... DL actually had grounds to disavow it</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[12]" title="press . then 12 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <p>A Tibetan negotiator recalled that instances indeed exist when the Tibetan delegates, with the DL's authorization, were free to suggest an alteration</p>

      <p>Subsequently, due to his self-imposed exile, the DL has rejected the agreement. </p>

      <p>As always, the United States, an ardent opponent of communism stuck its head in the situation. </p>

      <p>In June of 1951, according to declassified State Department memo, the elder brother of the Dalai Lama, Thubten Jigme Norbu, known as Taktse Rinpoche, <a href="https://books.google.ie/books?id=C_W0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT227&amp;lpg=PT227&amp;dq=taktse+rinpoche+evan+wilson+robert+linn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oUMgWMsBw8&amp;sig=Bn4GyZjSKzo9R7tIhrFnRtNkNrU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiT7dGF7-XdAhUrCMAKHQrqBNEQ6AEwAHoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=taktse%20rinpoche%20evan%20wilson%20robert%20linn&amp;f=false">met with the U.S. Consul General Evan M. Wilson, his attaché Robert H. Linn, two vice consuls, as well as George Patterson (referred to as a “missionary,” which was hardly the reason for the presence of this famous explorer at this meeting). The subject of the meeting was, “organizing of resistance in Tibet [and] the provision of military and financial assistance ...” to the young, sixteen-year-old, king.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[13]" title="press . then 13 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <p>Analysis of recently-declassified documents on the flight of the Dalai Lama from Tibet to India reveals the extent which the Tibetan leader was used by American Intelligence as a propaganda tool against Chinese communism. In return, the Tibetan leader asked for military assistance to support an armed resistance movement against the Chinese…One that would use Tibetan monasteries and temples as “ safe houses “ and part of an underground intelligence and support network.</p>

      <p>In 1952, the Dalai Lama was told: <a href="https://books.google.ie/books?id=LQJZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWe+believe+that+if+you+should+return+to+China,+your+life+will+be+in+jeopardy%E2%80%A6.they+will+murder+you+the+moment+your+usefulness+to+them+is+over%E2%80%A6if+you+Leave+Tibet+and+if+you+organise+resistance+to+the+Chinese+communists,+we+are+prepared+to+send+you+light+arms+through+India.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b50WubNGe3&amp;sig=4eA7CFywcvKNOF7-0SCT1qyk6ao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwitl42a8uXdAhUFOsAKHTfUCh4Q6AEwAHoECAkQAQ">“We believe that if you should return to China, your life will be in jeopardy….they will murder you the moment your usefulness to them is over…if you Leave Tibet and if you organise resistance to the Chinese communists, we are prepared to send you light arms through India."</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[14]" title="press . then 14 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <p>Operations had aimed to strengthen a number of isolated Tibetan resistance groups, which <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v30/d337">eventually led to the creation of a paramilitary force on the Nepalese border with approximately 2,000 men</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[15]" title="press . then 15 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <p>The CIA carried out several secret operations including:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>

          <p><a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/656/tibets_gamble">St. Circus, where Tibetan rebels were trained at Saipan and at Colorado</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[16]" title="press . then 16 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      </ul>

      <p>Groups they trained included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chushi_Gangdruk">Chushi Gangdruk, who were trained alongside others at Camp Hale.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[19]" title="press . then 19 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button collapsed selftext" title="" data-host="wikipedia"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="wikipedia"></div></p>

      <p>The CIA also used Tibetan troops to fight for India against Bangladesh.</p>

      <p>In 1955, the US department of State reported that they would use something called the Tibet Flood relief committee, <a href="https://case.edu/affil/tibet/tibetanSociety/documents/usstuff.PDF">“ for propaganda coup against Chinese communists, and buttress position Tibetan resistance groups”</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[20]" title="press . then 20 and Enter to open link"></span> </p>

      <p>A January 9 1964 state department memorandum with the stated line “ review of Tibetan operations” was approved where it states <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v30/d337">“The CIA Tibetan activity consists of political action, propaganda, and paramilitary activity. The Purpose of the program at this stage is to keep the political concept of an autonomous Tibet alive within Tibet and among foreign nations, principally India, and to build a capability for resistance against possible political developments inside Communist China….[The CIA] is supporting the establishment of Tibet Houses in [classified], Geneva, NYC. The Tibet houses are intended to serve as unofficial representation for the Dalai Lama and to maintain the concept of a separate political identity. The Tibet house in NYC will work closely with Tibetan supporters in the UN, particularly the Malayan, the Irish, and Thai delegations.”</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[21]" title="press . then 21 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <p>A memo from the US embassy in New delhi on feb 11 2010 states:<a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10NEWDELHI290_a.html">“ Approximately 6000 Tibetans now serve and over 30,000 Tibetans have been trained, in establishment 22, a joint Tibetan-Nepali border force within the Indian army that reportedly emerged in 1962 following a failed Tibetan uprising in China. Membership in establishment 22 was compulsory for Tibetan students graduating from Tibetan children’s Village schools (TCV) until the late 1980’s….They fought..in Operation Meghdoot during the 1999 Indo-Pakistan fighting in Kargil “</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[22]" title="press . then 22 and Enter to open link"></span> </p>

      <p>In other words, the CIA forcibly conscripted Tibetans in wars that had nothing to do with Tibet. </p>

      <p>By 1973, as the US eagerly greeted China under Deng, <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/09/cias-cancelled-war-tibet/">they canceled the paramilitary training and ended the DL's monthly payments</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[23]" title="press . then 23 and Enter to open link"></span></p>
