      <p>Let’s do a little debunking shall we? This post will debunk the claims made in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/eeb2c9/ulogiman43_explains_why_china_is_the_nazi_germany/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">this post</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span>, and demonstrate that China is not committing a genocide on Uyghurs. This is going to be a huge info dump so hopefully it can disseminate the truth of the Xinjiang situation.</p>

      <p><strong>1)</strong> Why OP posts the testimony of Scott Busby is unknown to me. Busby provides zero sources for his claims except for this</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Since April 2017, Chinese authorities have detained at least 800,000, and possibly more than 2 million, Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities in internment camps for indefinite periods of time. This is the U.S. government assessment, backed by our intelligence community and open source reporting. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>So, we’re just supposed to take at face value that if the “intelligence community” says it true, then it’s true? What about the countless times they’ve lied to us? Does nobody remember the WMDs of Iraq, a blatant lie which caused a war that has killed anywhere from 500,000 - 1 million Iraqis (most of which were Muslim, mind you)? That people should be expected to just accept everything that the CIA tells them is just plain wrong. And before anyone says anything, no this is not simple whataboutism, it is pointing out that the country which has committed the most human rights abuses toward Muslims is currently accusing China of human rights abuses toward Muslims, and that when that country founds their own abuses on lies, perhaps we should not be so ready to go along with whatever they say to demonize nations. </p>

      <p>And if you honestly believe this:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>As the President’s National Security Strategy states, “the United States supports those who seek freedom, individual dignity, and the rule of law...and we will advocate on behalf of religious freedom and threatened minorities.” Governments that respect human rights remain the best vehicle for prosperity, human happiness, and peace. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md">then you are beyond hopeless</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span>. Almost all the things Busby accuses China of doing, America is doing/has done. </p>

      <p>But I digress. We now get to an important source <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang-rights/15-million-muslims-could-be-detained-in-chinas-xinjiang-academic-idUSKCN1QU2MQ">with this</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span>. There are only two sources for the “1.5 million” estimate, the first one being Adrian Zenz. To give you a little backstory on Zenz, I will quote at length from <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/21/china-detaining-millions-uyghurs-problems-claims-us-ngo-researcher/">this article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>A born-again Christian who claims to preach at his local church, Adrian Zenz is a lecturer at the <a href="https://www.c-span.org/person/?adrianzenz">European School of Culture and Theology</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5]" title="press 5 to open link"></span>. This anodyne-sounding campus is actually the German base of Columbia International University, a US-based evangelical Christian seminary which considers the “Bible [to be] the ultimate foundation and the <a href="http://www.ciu.edu/about-ciu/faith-purpose-values/core-values">“final truth in every aspect of our lives,”</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span> and whose mission is to “<a href="http://www.ciu.edu/about-ciu/faith-purpose-values/mission">educate people from a biblical worldview</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[7]" title="press 7 to open link"></span> to impact the nations with the message of Christ.” 
Zenz’s work on China is inspired by this biblical worldview, as he recently explained in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-german-data-diver-who-exposed-chinas-muslim-crackdown-11558431005">interview with Wall Street Journal</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[8]" title="press 8 to open link"></span>. “I feel very clearly led by God to do this,” he said. “I can put it that way. I’m not afraid to say that. With Xinjiang, things really changed. It became like a mission, or a ministry.”
Along with his “mission” against China, heavenly guidance has apparently prompted Zenz to denounce homosexuality, gender equality, and the banning of physical punishment against children as threats to Christianity.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>So now we have a good sense of who Adrian Zenz is: an end-times evangelical nutjob. In addition he is a fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Fund, an organization founded by the US government in 1993 by Ukrainian nationalist Lev Dobriansky and co-chaired by Yaroslav Stetsko, <a href="https://fpif.org/seven-decades-nazi-collaboration-americas-dirty-little-ukraine-secret/">a literal Nazi</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[9]" title="press 9 to open link"></span>. VoC effectively acts as a propaganda arm of the US gov. </p>

      <p>So, in summary, Adrian Zenz is a far-right religious whackjob sent on a mission by God, and who is a fellow at an organization founded by and previously headed by Nazi collaborators, and who seems to have no background in studying Xinjiang ethnic relations but is somehow an “expert on Xinjiang.” Good to know. Now to move on to the source of Zenz’s claims. His original claim of “anywhere between several hundred thousand and just over one million” was made <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02634937.2018.1507997?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[10]" title="press 0 to open link"></span>. I will once again quote the Grayzone article at length, because I’m lazy lol</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Zenz arrived at his estimate “over 1 million” in a dubious manner. He based it on a single report by Istiqlal TV, a Uyghur exile media organization based in Turkey, which was <a href="https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/stories/world/2018/03/89-3_1.php">republished by Newsweek Japan</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[11]" title="press . then 11 and Enter to open link"></span>.  Far from an impartial journalistic organization, Istiqlal TV advances the separatist cause while playing host to an assortment of extremist figures. One such character who often appears on Istiqlal TV is Abdulkadir Yapuquan, a reported leader of the <a href="https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/china-evolution-etim">East Turkistan Islamic Movement</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[12]" title="press . then 12 and Enter to open link"></span> (ETIM), a separatist group that aims to establish an independent homeland in Xinjiang called East Turkestan. ETIM has been designated as a terrorist organization with ties to al-Qaeda <a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123086.htm">by the US</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[13]" title="press . then 13 and Enter to open link"></span>, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32012R0034">European Union</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[14]" title="press . then 14 and Enter to open link"></span>, and UN Security Council’s <a href="https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1267/aq_sanctions_list/summaries/entity/eastern-turkistan-islamic-movement">Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[15]" title="press . then 15 and Enter to open link"></span>. <a href="https://apnews.com/1a7aad978ad5470bb6450ef13f86469e">The Associated Press</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[16]" title="press . then 16 and Enter to open link"></span> has reported that since “2013, thousands of Uighurs… have traveled to Syria to train with the Uighur militant group Turkistan Islamic Party and fight alongside al-Qaida,” with “several hundred join[ing] the Islamic State.” </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The report from Istiqlal TV is not only dubious by association, but completely unverified and unverifiable. It claims that ~900,000 Uyghurs are detained as of spring 2018, but, again, this is unverified. He also relies on <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/detentions-01222018171657.html">this Radio Free Asia report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[17]" title="press . then 17 and Enter to open link"></span>, which, again, is unverified and unverifiable. More curious, however, is this passage from the report</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The security chief of Kashgar city’s Chasa township recently told RFA on condition of anonymity that “approximately 120,000” Uyghurs are being held throughout the prefecture, based on information he has received from other area officials.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Sooo…does he want to remain anonymous or not? Why would he give his job title and location away if he wants to “remain anonymous”? Just something to think about. It is also worth pointing out that RFA is an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/26/archives/worldwide-propaganda-network-built-by-the-cia-a-worldwide-network.html">overt propaganda organ of the CIA</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[18]" title="press . then 18 and Enter to open link"></span>. </p>

      <p>So, all in all, we have nothing of actual substance that corroborates this 1.5 million figure (or any such enormous figure) by Adrian Zenz. </p>

      <p>The other “source” used in the Reuters article is testimony from Omar Bekali, which gets a whopping four lines dedicated to him in the entire article. So I have to ask: why exactly is there nothing to corroborate his story? Why does he have no scars, why did he not take pictures of his bruised and tortured body after being released as some semblance of proof? If all the other information points to the fact that China is not committing the crimes Bekali accuses it of committing, why exactly should I believe him? Why should I unquestioningly absorb “witness testimony”?</p>

      <p>The last article cited for this section is just more unsupported nonsense. I won’t bother with it. Before I go on to the next section I’d like to point out one thing in response to this</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Life in Xinjiang outside these internment camps is not much better. The Chinese government is engaged in an effort to monitor every aspect of life for Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups. Families have been forced to accept Communist officials into their homes for extended “home stays.” Thousands of mosques have been shuttered or destroyed; some have even been converted into Communist propaganda centers. Those that are still open are often guarded and monitored, and entry is limited via checkpoints with electronic ID scanners. Neighborhoods also have entry and exit checkpoints manned by armed police. The pervasive surveillance in place across Xinjiang today has been frequently described as an “open-air prison.” </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This is blatantly not true. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/7KvC89nKCHo">scores of videos</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[19]" title="press . then 19 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div> of people living normal lives in Xinjiang. </p>

      <p><strong>2)</strong> I quote from the source provided</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>While the experiences described could not be independently verified, local rights groups and lawyers say they are common and reveal a wider pattern of abuse directed specifically against women, aimed at curbing their ability to reproduce.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>All you should really know is that these are independently unverified. But, I will go the extra mile. The first person cited is Gulzira Mogdyn. A cursory google search doesn’t return anything on this person beside other articles which more or less say what the article OP cited says. You occasionally come across articles such as <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/5094224/china-accused-of-mass-rape-program-forcing-uighur-women-to-marry-men-chosen-by-the-state-to-promote-ethnic-unity/">this</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[20]" title="press . then 20 and Enter to open link"></span>, which would seem strange to anyone who is aware of the <a href="https://paa2014.princeton.edu/papers/140779">ethnic minority exemptions for the one-child policy</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[21]" title="press . then 21 and Enter to open link"></span> in China that ended in 2015</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>In most parts of China, couples with at least one side being an ethnic minority are allowed to give birth to two or more babies. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>They even admit this in the article. Yet for some reason, after the one-child policy was scrapped, they suddenly want to take the opposite position, that of <em>preventing</em> Uyghur women from giving birth. And yet, where is the evidence for this? Mogdyn is the main piece, whose claims are unverifiable and she is more or less unfindable on anything but news reports <em>about</em> her. The second piece of evidence they cite is “a Kazakh woman.” I don’t think I need to explain why we can disregard this. So, it would seem, we really have no reason to believe this is the case, do we? They next make this claim</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>In addition to mistreating detained women, rights groups and experts say Beijing has pursued a campaign to erase Muslim culture in Xinjiang, by pushing interethnic marriages and sending Chinese officials for “home stays” with Muslim families, part of efforts by president Xi Jinping’s government to assimilate ethnic minorities.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This is often claimed by detractors of China. Once again it is not only unverifiable, but patently false. Islam has been growing in China, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mosques_in_China#cite_note-2">25,000 mosques</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[22]" title="press . then 22 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button collapsed selftext" title="" data-host="wikipedia"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="wikipedia"></div> in Xinjiang alone, up from 9,000 in 1984. With regard to the interethnic marriage claim, I quote from <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1004884261051092993.html">here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[23]" title="press . then 23 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>As for “forced” marriage between Uyghur and Han people, there’s no evidence of this. All that can be found are government incentives for intermarriage. Not so sinister.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The Chinese government has no inherent enmity with Muslim culture, and has done much to both protect them and allow them to flourish, as can be seen <a href="https://time.com/3099950/china-muslim-hui-xinjiang-uighur-islam/">here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[24]" title="press . then 24 and Enter to open link"></span>, <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1067405.shtml">here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[25]" title="press . then 25 and Enter to open link"></span>, and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/china-launches-anti-poverty-drive-restive-xinjiang-180218150517058.html">here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[26]" title="press . then 26 and Enter to open link"></span>. </p>

      <p>They next make the following claim</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>All of this amounts to genocide as laid out by the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, said Rushan Abbas, founder and executive director of the Washington-based Campaign for Uyghurs.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>I was wondering when Rushan Abbas would come up, a <a href="https://archive.is/9mV6L?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">known CIA asset</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[27]" title="press . then 27 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button image collapsed" title="" data-host="archive.is"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="archive.is"></div> who worked in Guantanamo Bay, overseeing the illegal detainment and torture of Muslims. The genocide claim only works if the claims made thus far are true or verified, of which they are neither. And, frankly, Rushan clearly does not really care about Muslims. </p>

      <p>The same story follows with Ruqiye Perhat, who returns nothing but stories about her, much in the same way as Mogdyn. The only “different” thing about her is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ICNACSJ/posts/meet-sister-ruqiye-perhat-from-uyghur-in-2009-she-was-arrested-charged-for-pract/2167747513257257/">this Facebook post</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[28]" title="press . then 28 and Enter to open link"></span>. They cite a few more “witnesses” whose claims are unverifiable, of course, and mostly just keep on with trying to come up with the shocking things they can and say China did that to them. Next.</p>

      <p><strong>3)</strong> <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d674d32417a4d33457a6333566d54/index.html?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Mihrigul Tursun is a known liar</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[29]" title="press . then 29 and Enter to open link"></span>. I quote the following passages</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>In a recent CNN interview, a woman named Mihrigul Tursun claimed one of her three children was killed by the Chinese government. She said she was separated from her triplets at the Urumqi airport in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and held in custody in 2015. </p>

        <p>About 1,000 kilometers away from Urumqi, Qiemo County is where Mihrigul's parents and brother live.
Mihrigul's mother, Mailikanmu Aimaiti took out a photo of her grandson Moez. She said Mihrigul brought the photo to her in July 2016. "Her son is in Egypt now, being raised by my son-in-law's sister."</p>

        <p>Mihrigul not only fabricated the story about her child's death, but also made false accusations against China's education and training centers in Xinjiang. She claimed she was jailed and tortured in the facility, and she saw fellow prisoners die in detention. But again, that turns out to be far from truth, as her brother told CGTN that she had never been to a education and training center. "She made that up. It was a lie." According to Hua Chunying, the spokesperson of China's foreign ministry, Mihrigul was detained by Qiemo county in 2017 for inciting hatred and discrimination among ethnic minority groups. She was detained for 20 days, and was released after she was found infected with contagious diseases. Hua said Mihrigul was never arrested in Urumqi and never went to jail, nor has she been sent to any vocational training and education centers.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>That’s all that really needs to be said about her. </p>

      <p>The second source reiterates claims made by “witnesses,” some of which I’ve already discussed, others which are just as unreliable and unverified. They also cite Adrian Zenz specifically when giving the supposed number of Muslims detained. Most of this is shit I’ve already covered, which makes this source useless. One interesting thing is this passage.</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>China has <strong>blamed</strong> violent attacks in Xinjiang in recent years on Islamist extremists bent on waging holy war on the state, with radical ideas said to be coming from abroad over the Internet and from visits to foreign countries by Uighurs, the region’s predominant ethnic group.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>I highlight the word “blame” above to show that they think terrorism in Xinjiang was not a significant issue, which is <a href="https://21stcenturywire.com/2018/12/14/the-truth-behind-chinas-uyghur-problem/">patently false</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[30]" title="press . then 30 and Enter to open link"></span>. Next. </p>

      <p><strong>4)</strong> This one is just a reddit comment. The sources are pretty much the same thing we’ve been seeing over and over again, the same few people’s testimony (they cite Mihrigul Tursun lol) for the most part. Why exactly are we trusting unverified testimony? The Sayragul Sauytbay claims are what you’d expect, classic scare tactic horror stories meant to shut down any rational response which could question the validity of her statements. For the BBC article claiming “1 million Uyghurs detained,” either see the previous Grayzone article for an explanation of how this article got its information (the short version is that they extrapolated a population trend for an area of 20 million people by interviewing eight (anonymous!) people), and we must note that this was <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2018/08/23/un-did-not-report-china-internment-camps-uighur-muslims/">not told by the UN</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[31]" title="press . then 31 and Enter to open link"></span>.</p>

      <p><strong>5)</strong> I would just like everyone to know that I suffered through a full Vice video for this. You’re welcome. I took several notes as the video dragged on. This section will probably be more informal than the rest. </p>

      <p>-Once again they frame the problem of Islamic extremism as China just “blaming” it on the Uyghurs, when it reality China has had a long standing issue of demonstrable Islamic extremism among the Uyghur population. CGTN has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4cYE6E27_g&amp;has_verified=1">this documentary</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[32]" title="press . then 32 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div> which outlines the extent of terrorism in Xinjiang (inb4 “CGTN is state run media therefore I won’t acknowledge anything they show or say,” even without this it is impossible to deny the extent of terrorism in Xinjiang). <a href="https://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2018/10/chinas-uyghur-problem-unmentioned-part.html">Evidence of the extent</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[33]" title="press . then 33 and Enter to open link"></span> of the extremist groups in Xinjiang, many of which have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-china/syria-says-up-to-5000-chinese-uighurs-fighting-in-militant-groups-idUSKBN1840UP">moved into Syria</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[34]" title="press . then 34 and Enter to open link"></span>, and which by and large <a href="https://www.voltairenet.org/article202535.html">work with Al-Qaida</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[35]" title="press . then 35 and Enter to open link"></span>, is well documented.

      <p>The World Uyghur Congress has been a key accuser of the Chinese government.

      <p>-Casual downplaying of the seriousness of the Urumqi riots, which left 100 people dead. Very cool, Vice.  </p>

      <p>-Repeating unverified 1 million figure.  </p>

      <p>-Wow, Xinjiang has police. From the Goodrum thread, I quote</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>In addition to hiring more personnel, through this measure the government has widened the functions of police stations, following a “community-based policing” model many departments around the world are emulating now. You can take a deep dive into the police recruitment numbers here. The first two “tiers” are regular police and local security forces, respectively. The third tier is assistant police staff. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfIXq6aU8AAEPab.jpg" class="hoverZoomLink">infographic</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[43]" title="press . then 43 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button image collapsed" title="" data-host="twimg"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="twimg"></div></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>-Wow, places have security.</p>

      <p>-Acting like she needs a “disguise” just to be there lmfao what? People in Xinjiang are allowed to travel I don’t know why she seems to think this isn’t the case.</p>

      <p>-The Han woman on the train perhaps does not phrase the actual intention of China in saying “we need to be the same,” but what she ultimately means is that ethnic unity is promoted by the Chinese government. From the Goodrum thread, quote</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The principle of ethnic unity is paramount in China, so special care is taken to emphasize its importance. This is why separatism is a matter of deep concern to the government.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This is why special treatment is often given to ethnic minorities.</p>

      <p>-Is there a reason we have to rely on anonymous sources for this? If she’s supposed to be “undercover” because the media is so repressed in Xinjiang, how did he know she was media? </p>

      <p>-Yes, Kashgar has surveillance. Again from Goodrum,</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>For example, the restive prefecture of Kashgar has heavier surveillance and stricter controls than Turpan. This is due to the former’s more conservative religious traditions and its current status as a hotbed of anti-China sentiment.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>-This restrictive reporting makes Xinjiang look bleak and gloomy by design. Very low shit. Oh, the police are going back to the police station and not talking? How chilling. </p>

      <p>-What sources are telling them that the Kashgar police are onto them? This is a common tactic used by bad journalists: saying something comes from “sources” but not specifying who. </p>

      <p>-We have Mr. Bekali again. And people saying things like “I opened a Uyghur language school, so they took me,”  when Uyghur is literally an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_language#CITEREFEnges%C3%A6th2009">official language in Xinjiang</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[44]" title="press . then 44 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button collapsed selftext" title="" data-host="wikipedia"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="wikipedia"></div>. Quote,</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Uyghur is an official language of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and is widely used in both social and official spheres, as well as in print, television and radio and is used as a common language by other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>As an official language, this means that it is also used governmentally. How exactly is it that the government can both “crack down” on Uyghur language speakers and also use the Uyghur language? </p>

      <p>-If Mr. Bekali confessed to “organizing and sheltering terrorists,” there is a good chance he would be imprisoned right now. Fortunately, he isn’t, so I will assume he is lying. </p>

      <p>-Why do they not show us the document declaring the woman a terrorist? Hearing Mr. Bekali describe China as trying to create “communist robots” also sounds like pure red scare rhetoric. Again, with all his claims of being brutally tortured, you’d think we’d have some sort of physical evidence of this. </p>

      <p>-What evidence is there that the video the woman played is an “education camp”? It looks like a regular school. They tracked it to “a kindergarten” as they say, so what makes them think they are in a camp? Because it’s 300 miles from her hometown? If Adrian Zenz is to be believed, there are 1200 camps in Xinjiang, why would the Chinese government relocate them so far away? And how exactly do they conflate the increase in kindergartens to the establishment of education camps? Why would the Chinese government report the building of these alleged camps in the number of kindergartens built in the region? Perhaps the increase in kindergartens means that education is becoming more accessible than it already is to people in the region? Can someone explain to me what the problem is with the government providing school and child care to children of people detained? I see literally no issue with this. If all Vice is going to do is speculate, we are free to speculate our own causes, none of which should be taken at face value. </p>

      <p>-Perhaps we should take the testimony of people <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5B1X8Vy9WLM&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1577195410080000">we know live in an practice Islam in Xinjiang</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[45]" title="press . then 45 and Enter to open link"></span> over unknowns making bold claims. </p>

      <p>-Oh don’t worry, all the proof you need that people are being disappeared is showing one padlocked gate and one abandoned looking house. </p>

      <p>Total drivel, Vice continues to show itself as shit. Once again I cite <a href="https://youtu.be/7KvC89nKCHo">this youtube channel</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[46]" title="press . then 46 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div> to showcase how surprisingly not dystopian Xinjiang is. </p>

      <p><strong>6)</strong> Another video. This one proves the catalyst for something which westerners seem completely unable to recognize. After citing <a href="https://bitterwinter.org/exclusive-video-transformation-through-education-camp-for-uyghurs-exposed-in-xinjiang/">here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[47]" title="press . then 47 and Enter to open link"></span> that a reporter, “whose anonymity should be protected,” (of course) casually waltzed into a “re-education camp”, they proceed to show its rather jail-like structure. The windows have guard railing, the dormitories have iron barred doors. There are surveillance cameras throughout the building. Now tell me: do any prisons in the world not have these? The fundamental point to be made here is that, yes, people are <em>detained</em> in these vocational centers, they effectively act as prisons, but the structure of their imprisonment is important. These are by and large people who have not committed outright terrorism but who have been shown to be susceptible to commit terrorism based the tendencies of previous known terrorists in the region, or are already engaged in these violent ideologies. What separates them is <em>what</em> they do with their imprisonment. We’ve already had <a href="https://youtu.be/TCtY68_QA0g">looks inside these centers</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[48]" title="press . then 48 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div> (which makes the need for some super secretive “penetration” of an unused one look fairly silly) which reveal that despite their being locked up, they are given a significant amount of freedom and are being trained to contribute to society, namely through job training, which is what the Chinese government has <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/government/whitepaper/node_8014421.htm">long claimed</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[49]" title="press . then 49 and Enter to open link"></span>. So what does this amount to? Rehabilitation. Whereas in America, where people in prison are subject to these somehow horrible conditions present in the Chinese vocational center, they are ostensibly not rehabilitated for any of their crimes, the emphasis being put on pure punishment. Are we supposed to rebuke China for trying to control the terrorist sentiment that had been bubbling in Xinjiang, should they just have ignored the problem, allow people who seek separatist and violent actions to flourish? Even after so many people have already been killed by separatist terrorism? Is it not more humane to teach people why they’re wrong and destructive, and give them pathways for alleviating themselves of poor conditions which often contribute heavily to the sentiment of extremism? People who leave the camps are routinely given jobs by the government should they be unable to get one by themselves. Does this sound like they’re trying to exterminate them? By, what, <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1135881.shtml">trying to reduce poverty</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[50]" title="press . then 50 and Enter to open link"></span> and push for economic growth in Xinjiang? </p>

      <p>Extremist ideologies such as those held by ETIM are not just “different opinions,” they are a threat to the security of China. What would you have done if you discovered a large terrorist cell in your country?</p>

      <p>Anyway, they point out the propaganda posters in the vocational center as well. To that I say “who cares?” I see no problem with a country trying to reinforce its state ideology.</p>

      <p>Also, at <a href="https://youtu.be/uQHuOfKgNsI?t=207">3:27</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[51]" title="press . then 51 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div> in the video, we clearly see another person in the building in the bottom left frame. Is the center open to the public or something? This seems unlikely, but if it was the case it would show either incredible transparency from the PRC gov or incredible sloppiness.</p>

      <p>“It is nearly impossible for the people being held in these buildings to escape,” isn’t that kind of the point of detainment? Lol. Once again they also have an abstract “insider source,” of which of course they can tell us nothing about or verify the truth of. </p>

      <p>Just showing that one thing is <em>like</em> another thing is not enough to condemn it, the historical context of the thing and the actual material structure of the thing (or program in this case) must be regarded first and foremost. This video does none of that. Next.</p>

      <p><strong>7)</strong> This article is so ridiculously misleading. All of the sources provided in the article are in Chinese, so most Westerners who come upon it will not likely not go to the trouble of translating what it says and take what the secondary source says at face value. I do not know Chinese, but I do know how to use google translate, so I will be referring to the “google translated” pieces of the sources. </p>

      <p>First, the title of the article is “China forces its Muslim minority to install spyware on their phones.” But if we look at the <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shaoshuminzu/ql2-07132017112039.html">primary source for this</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[52]" title="press . then 52 and Enter to open link"></span>, we get the following information</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Tianshan District Government of Urumqi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, issued a "Notice on the Use of Mobile Phone Terrorist Audio and Video Self-examination Software" to residents' mobile phone users, and urged people <strong>of all nationalities</strong> to install and use the software "net guards" for self-inspection.</p>

        <p>On July 10, the Tianshan District Government of Urumqi issued a notice to the residents of <strong>all ethnic groups</strong> via mobile phone WeChat, saying that in order to seriously implement the municipal committee ’s arrangements for the “three clean-ups” and effectively implement the violent terrorist audio and video clean-up work in the entire field "Coverage", the Municipal Public Security Bureau developed the violent terror audio and video editing software "Net Guardian" installed on mobile phones with Android operating system for installation and use by the people of <strong>all ethnic groups</strong> in the city for self-inspection.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>So it would seem that the article lies by omission, only claiming Muslims had to install the app when in fact everyone did. They also say</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>A Kazakh person told Radio Free Asia on July 13 that Horgos police arrested 10 Kazakh women on the 11th. He said: "The arrest of 10 Kazakh women was accused of what they should not discuss in the WeChat group. One of the women was named Carmela. These 10 women are ordinary women and have nothing to do with politics or religion." .</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>They cite this “Kazakh person” twice - do I really have to point out why this shouldn’t be believed? For one, we already established that RFA is a propaganda program created by the CIA, and second we have more vague, anonymous sourcing which offers us zero verifiable claims of which we are expected to believe at face value. As for the source which the article claims substantiates that those who didn’t install the app were detained for 10 days, we have a single tweet which translates to</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Xinjiang ’s mobile phones checked and installed the official NetGuard software, which was installed within 10 days of the SMS notification. During the physical inspection, it was found that no detention was installed for 10 days. Back to the hairy era</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>To be totally honest, I can’t make heads or tails of what this is meant to say, so unless someone else can better translate it for me I will not make any claims as to its legitimacy. </p>

      <p>As for the claim that China is banning Muslim customs such as beards and veils (Uyghur women do not traditionally wear veils), I direct you back to <a href="https://youtu.be/TCtY68_QA0g">this video</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[53]" title="press . then 53 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div>, which shows people in Xinjiang with these supposed “abnormal beards” and showing off their culture. </p>

      <p><strong>8)</strong> <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/chinas-detention-of-uighurs-video-of-blindfolded-and-shackled-prisoners-authentic-11815401">Ahem…</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[54]" title="press . then 54 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Sky News was not able independently to verify the footage.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Lol. But seriously, this suffers from the same problem as pretty much every source before. The article states</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The European security source said: "We've examined the footage and believe it to be genuine.”</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>and of course we are just expected to believe it if a “European security source” (whatever that means) said it’s true. We do not need to be given evidence which we can analyze for ourselves, we just need to be told its true. Ridiculous that Westerners accuse the PRC of brainwashing its citizens when they believe anything told to them as long as the anonymous source for the claim sounds official enough. </p>

      <p>They also recycle the 1 million figure which is false. They say this as well</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>United Nations experts have spoken of "credible reports" of China holding one million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities at mass detention camps in Xinjiang.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Which requires I cite <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2018/08/23/un-did-not-report-china-internment-camps-uighur-muslims/">this article</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[55]" title="press . then 55 and Enter to open link"></span> again and remind people that the UN did <em>not</em> claim it had “credible reports” of concentration camps in Xinjiang. People will likely say, “well what’s going on in the video is still bad,” but we have literally zero context as to what this video is depicting. Not useful in the slightest without context. </p>

      <p><strong>9)</strong> From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/26/what-has-happened-to-me-manga-depicting-uighur-torture-hits-25m-views">The Guardian</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[56]" title="press . then 56 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Shimizu’s short manga, which has been translated into English, Chinese, Uighur and other languages, tells the story of Mihrigul Tursun, a Uighur woman who was detained three times by the Chinese authorities after returning from Egypt.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>And, as we know from section 3, <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d674d32417a4d33457a6333566d54/index.html?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Mihrigul Tursun is a liar who made up her story</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[57]" title="press . then 57 and Enter to open link"></span>. So this can be disregarded. (Bro it’s just like Maus!!!1! shut the fuck up)</p>

      <p><strong>10)</strong> I’d like to point this out first</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The government describes such efforts as a response to terrorism. Indeed, these camps can be seen as a logical, if grotesque, extension of the government’s decades-long endeavor to eradicate the perceived “terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism” of its ethnic minority Muslim population in Xinjiang. The region, and the country, has certainly experienced spasms of unplanned mass violence, as well as cases of premeditated violence stemming from the Uighurs’ desperation after decades of discrimination and persecution; the government’s current set of policies to avoid future strife, however, appears to rest on the assumption that most Uighurs are extremists-in-waiting.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>First, the terrorism, separatism, and extremism among Uyghur communities is not just “perceived,” it is real. I’ve already cited many sources to show this, so just refer to one of them if you need a refresher. These sources also refute the claims in the above quote that they are just “unplanned mass violence” - I do agree that “Uyghur desperation” has contributed to extremism amongst Uyghur communities, but do not be fooled into thinking the violence is just a bunch of lone wolves. They are not, they were by and large orchestrated by ETIM. Again, I’ve already cited several sources for this. As for the last sentence, considering the fact that the 1 million figure has never been verified (<a href="https://journal-neo.org/2018/10/24/us-fueling-terrorism-in-china/">here’s another source in case you haven’t been convinced</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[58]" title="press . then 58 and Enter to open link"></span> ), and we do not know how many have been detained, this is an unsubstantiated claim. </p>

      <p>The rest of the article is entirely sourceless, detailing specific plans such as the following</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The relatives have been essentially conscripted into service in three separate waves. The first campaign started in 2014, dispatching some 200,000 party members, including minority party members, to “Visit the People, Benefit the People, and Bring Together the Hearts of the People” (fang minqing, hui minsheng, ju minxin)—through long-term stays in Uighur villages. In 2016, a second wave of 110,000 civil servants were sent into Uighur villages as part of a “United as One Family” (jie dui renqin) campaign, which focused on placing relatives in the homes of Uighurs whose family members had been imprisoned or killed by the police.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>but then offering us nothing to support the claim. The article is even comical at times, such as this passage</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>At times, the big brothers and sisters feared the Uighurs might be slippery, that however cheerfully they might open their houses or declare their loyalty to the Chinese nation, beneath their smiles and gestures of wholesome secularism there might lurk darker allegiances, uncured attachments to their diseased religious ways. But there were simple ways to test for this kind of thing. One could offer a host a cigarette or a sip of beer; a hand could be extended in greeting to a little sibling of the opposite gender, staying alert for signs of flinching. Or one could go out to the market for some freshly ground meat and propose that the family make dumplings. And then wait and watch to see if the Uighurs would ask what kind of meat was in the bag.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>In which these Chinese “big brothers” test Muslims on what kind of meat they eat or if they flinch. Again, I’ve shown enough that shows they are not trying to eradicate Islam, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DZI2HEpCd3PA&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1577202228592000">and if they are they’re doing a terrible job</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[59]" title="press . then 59 and Enter to open link"></span>.</p>

      <p>The second source given in this section illuminates exactly where all these claims come from, namely a <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/cosleeping-10312019160528.html">Radio Free Asia report</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[60]" title="press . then 60 and Enter to open link"></span>. Do I have to remind you about them?</p>

      <p><strong>11)</strong> This one is a straight-up citation of RFA. Anyway, let’s look at the report</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>During the campaign, authorities demolished thousands of mosques to “rectify” the largely Muslim population, claiming that they were sorting out dilapidated buildings that posed a safety threat to worshippers in a bid to standardize and regulate the mosques. Though government officials in December 2016 refused to say how many mosques were destroyed, an investigation by RFA’s Uyghur Service indicated that around 5,000 mosques were demolished over the three months.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Why is it that these people can get away with just saying “we did an investigation and found…” without having to show the content of the investigation or <em>how</em> they got the numbers they got? Perhaps provide a link to an article which corroborates this investigative result? Wait, I forgot we’re dealing with the CIA here, who don’t need to verify their claims to be believed. They also do the thing again where they cite an “anonymous insider source,” but give his exact location and job title. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The secretary of Baghcha Village in Toqsu (Xinhe) county of Aksu (Akesu) prefecture, who did not give his name, told RFA last week that only one mosque of a total of five in Baghcha alone remain after authorities tore them down. “We used to have mosques in every neighborhood and village [in Toqsu county] but not anymore,” he said. “There used to be five mosques in five neighborhoods [in Baghcha village]; now we have only one big mosque.”</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Strange practice. Anyway, the growth of the amount of mosques in Xinjiang is demonstrable. </p>
