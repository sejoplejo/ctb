      <p>Hello comrades, it's Odarin again(sorry for not posting yesterday!). Today we will be taking a look at the myth that Stalin was a “Russian nationalist and hated Jews”. Lets try and debunk these myths together. </p>

      <p>Firstly, all nationalities under Stalin had equal rights no matter what race they were. This can be seen in Article 123 of the 1936 Soviet Constitution. It states that - “ Equality of rights of citizens of the U.S.S.R., irrespective of their nationality or race, in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social and political life, is an indefeasible law. Any direct or indirect restriction of the rights of, or, conversely, any establishment of direct or indirect privileges for citizens on account of their race or nationality, as well as any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness or hatred and contempt, is punishable by law”. This law does not exclude the Jewish population as Stalin himself had to say this about anti-semitism responding to a request from the Jewish Telegraph Agency from America, “Anti-Semitism, as an extreme form of racial chauvinism, is the most dangerous remnant of cannibalism.  In the USSR, anti-Semitism is strictly pursued by law as a phenomenon deeply hostile to the Soviet system.  Active anti-Semites are punishable by the laws of the USSR”.</p>

      <p>Under Stalin the whole Soviet population was able to read and write ie got there literacy. The Russian empire had a literacy rate of 21%(1897), while under Stalin, 100% of the population was fully literate by 1950 no matter the race or gender. </p>

      <p>The policy of Korenizatsiya started in 1913, but the full effect of it was under comrade Stalin. Stalin states that Russian chauvinism is of great danger to the Soviet Union and insists on the creation of the Soviet of Nationalities, which became one of the 2 chambers of the Supreme Soviet. As stated in article 37 of the 1936 Soviet constitution “both Chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities, have equal rights”. While “The Soviet of Nationalities is elected by the citizens of the U.S.S.R. according to Union and Autonomous Republics, Autonomous Regions and national areas on the basis of twenty-five deputies from each Union Republic, eleven deputies from each Autonomous Republic, five deputies from each Autonomous Region and one deputy from each national area” under article 35 of the Soviet Constitution. This shows that non ethnic Russians played a big role in the USSR and in the creation of laws, policies and electing high ranking officials. </p>

      <p>However, to find out how much of an “evil Russian nationalist” Stalin was, we must look at the number of people sent to Gulags. So, overall in 1939 there were 810 thousand Russians in Gulags. Furthermore, the Russian population of 1939 was 108,377,000, thus we can see that 0.75% of the Russian population were in Gulags(prisons). Now let's look at the other ethnic groups such as Ukrainians and Kazakhs. The Ukrainian population in 1939 was 33,425,000, while the number of those in Gulags was 182,536, that is 0.55% of the population. The Kazakh population was 6,081,000, while the number of those in Gulags was 17,333, that is 0.28% of the population. Thus, from this we can tell that more Russians were in Gulags compared to other Ethnic groups during Stalin’s time. </p>

      <p>We can apply the same to jews(Stalin even helped create Israel), some of Stalin’s closest friends were jews such as - Lazar Kaganovich, while many famous Soviet Jews received the "The State Stalin Prize". Those include:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Sergei Eisenstein</li>

        <li>Yuli Raizman</li>

        <li>Mikhail Romm</li>

      </ul>

      <p>So overall, we can tell that Stalin was indeed a true Soviet Communist and was not a Russian Nationalist and did not hate the Jewish people. Thank you for your time comrades and don’t forget to read my other two posts about Stalin and the USSR:</p>
