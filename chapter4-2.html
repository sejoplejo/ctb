      <p>I am currently working on a piece to lay out Socialism with Chinese Characteristics (“SWCC”) in a straightforward manner for everyone to understand. The purpose of this piece is to demonstrate the Marxist commitment the CCP has demonstrated over its decades, and how Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is not only a legitimate ideology, but reveals an extremely important pathway towards obtaining socialism and, ultimately, communism. </p>

      <p>However, I realized the immensity of this feat. Several academic sources from all spectrums of the left makes this an extremely complicated and complex subject to understand. However, those scholars and leaders committed to explaining SWCC are not doing it to justifying it through mental gymnastics through convoluted revisionism. There is a masterful logic of Marxism and Leninism that I am appreciating, thanks to reading and understandings these works. </p>

      <p>The keywords I am finding when trying to understand SWCC are "state capitalism", "transition", and "New Economic Policy (NEP)." Luckily, there is one significant pamphlet authored by our favorite Marxist (besides Marx, but even he said he’s not a Marxist, lol) that explains this all: Lenin. </p>

      <p><strong>1.) Demystifying the Phrase "State Capitalism"</strong></p>

      <p>Before I get into the text, there are some misleading inclinations from the left when it comes to the term "state capitalism." <strong>Lenin took an incredible amount of time in explaining state capitalism because of the left opposition that were taken aback by this position (as he stated “I can imagine with what noble indignation some people will recoil from these words. . . . What! The transition to state capitalism in the Soviet Socialist Republic would be a step forward? . . . Isn’t this the betrayal of socialism?”).</strong> This careful and detailed development caused so much turmoil and confusion in understanding the importance of this transitional phase. </p>

      <p><em>“But it’s authoritarian capitalism! It’s crony capitalism! Government controlling capitalism for itself!”</em></p>

      <p>Some leftists (especially in the West) use it as a negative definition where the state/government uses mechanisms of capital to control the means of production for its own benefit, and the benefit of capitalists, rather than the workers. <strong>Lenin agrees!</strong> However, Lenin makes the distinction between state capitalism where the government is controlled by the bourgeois, and when workers hold state power:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The state capitalism, which is one of the principal aspects of the New Economic Policy, is, under Soviet power, a form of capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class. <strong>Our state capitalism differs essentially from the state capitalism in countries that have bourgeois governments</strong> in that the state with us is represented not by the bourgeoisie, but by the proletariat, who has succeeded in winning the full confidence of the peasantry.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the introduction of state capitalism with us is not proceeding as quickly as we would like it. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>2.) Understanding “Transition”</strong> </p>

      <p>The previous statement from Lenin (“Unfortunately, the introduction of state capitalism with us is not proceeding as quickly as we would like it”) <strong>PREFECTLY</strong> emphasizes the importance of transition between capitalism and socialism through state capitalism. This section will show not only the importance of state capitalism, but why it is needed. Although there may be lots of copy and paste from the text, it is critical in understanding the importance of state capitalism as a critical stage to obtain socialism. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Firstly, we must examine the nature of the transition from capitalism to socialism that gives us the right and the grounds to call our country a Socialist Republic of Soviets… </p>

        <p>But what does the word “transition” mean? Does it not mean, as applied to an economy, that the present system contains elements, particles, fragments of both capitalism and socialism? Everyone will admit that it does. <strong>But not all who admit this take the trouble to consider what elements actually constitute the various socio-economic structures</strong> that exist in Russia at the present time. And this is the crux of the question.</p>

        <p>Let us enumerate these elements:</p>

        <p>(1)patriarchal, i.e., to a considerable extent natural, peasant farming;</p>

        <p>(2)small commodity production (this includcs the majority of those peasants who sell their grain);</p>

        <p>(3)private capitalism;</p>

        <p>(4)state capitalism;</p>

        <p>(5)socialism.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This is absolutely critical in understanding transition from capitalism to socialism. There are several socio-economic elements within a society that exist even after revolution, and it is necessary to understand all of their interactions in order to fully transition a state into socialism: </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Between what elements is this struggle being waged if we are to speak in terms of economic categories such as “state capitalism”? Between the fourth and fifth in the order in which I have just enumerated them? <strong>Of course not. It is not state capitalism that is at war with socialism, but the petty bourgeoisie plus private capitalism fighting together against state capitalism and socialism.</strong></p>

        <p>** The petty bourgeoisie oppose every kind of state interference, accounting and control, whether it be state-capitalist or state-socialist. This is an unquestionable fact of reality whose misunderstanding lies at the root of many economic mistakes.**</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Capitalists HATE interference. This is why many may find “state capitalism” to be an oxymoron. Capitalists do not want any restrictions or control from higher powers, especially the government ran by workers. Capitalists want unlimited exploitation to reap the rewards, wealth, and resources for themselves to either reinvest or enjoy. State interference obstructs capitalists from enjoying their exploitation. Lenin emphasizes this more by saying: </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The petty bourgeois who hoards his thousands is an enemy of state capitalism. He wants to employ these thousands just for himself, against the poor, in opposition to any kind of state control. And the sum total of these thousands, amounting to many thousands of millions, forms the base for profiteering, which undermines our socialist construction. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Lenin illustrates the link between this state capitalism and socialism transition:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>This simple illustration in figures, which I have deliberately simplified to the utmost in order to make it absolutely clear, explains the present correlation of state capitalism and socialism. The workers hold state power and have every legal opportunity of “taking” the whole thousand, without giving up a single [penny], except for socialist purposes. <strong>This legal opportunity, which rests upon the actual transition of power to the workers, is an element of socialism.</strong> But in many ways, the small-proprietary and private-capitalist element undermines this legal position, drags in profiteering and hinders the execution of Soviet decrees. State capitalism would be a gigantic step forward even if we paid more than we are paying at present, because it is worth paying for “tuition”, because it is useful for the workers, because victory over disorder, economic ruin and laxity is the most important thing, because the continuation of the anarchy of small ownership is the greatest, the most serious danger, and it will certainly be our ruin (unless we overcome it), <strong>whereas not only will the payment of a heavier tribute to state capitalism not ruin us, it will lead us to socialism by the surest road.</strong> When the working class has learned how to defend the state system against the anarchy of small ownership, when it has learned to organise large-scale production on a national scale along state-capitalist lines, it will hold, if I may use the expression, all the trump cards, and the consolidation of socialism will be assured.</p>

        <p><strong>In the first place economically state capitalism is immeasurably superior to our present [fragmented] economic system.</strong></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Lenin touches on the need to pay “tribute, tuition, payment” (aka taxes) to state capitalism, as it would go to the workers to and, ultimately, socialism. But this paragraph emphasizes the transitional need that state capitalism provides between capitalism immediately after revolution, and all its fragmented elements, into socialism. </p>

      <p><strong>3.) What is the purpose of “state capitalism?”</strong></p>

      <p><em>To develop productive forces.</em> Again, pointing towards the fragmented socio-economic elements, and after devastating wars, including imperialist infiltrators and counter revolutionaries attempting to take the power back from the communists, the Russian economy desperately needed to jump start its production on a massive national scale. It was not getting done by worker co-ops, anarchist communities, or profiteers exploiting the system. A mass governmental mobilization, controlled by the workers, was needed to keep production from failing. And the best part is, is that the capitalist actually <strong>helps</strong> to build towards socialism because of their very hunger for profit! </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The concessionaire is a capitalist. He conducts his business on capitalist lines, for profit, and is willing to enter into an agreement with the proletarian government in order to obtain superprofits or raw materials which he cannot otherwise obtain, or can obtain only with great difficulty. Soviet power gains by the development of the productive forces, and by securing an increased quantity of goods immediately, or within a very short period. We have, say, a hundred oilfields, mines and forest tracts. We cannot develop all of them for we lack the machines, the food and the transport. This is also why we are doing next to nothing to develop the other territories. Owing to the insufficient development of the large enterprises the small-proprietor element is more pronounced in all its forms, and this is reflected in the deterioration of the surrounding (and later the whole of) peasant farming, the disruption of its productive forces, the decline in its confidence in the Soviet power, pilfering and widespread petty (the most dangerous) profiteering, etc. By “implanting” state capitalism in the form of concessions, the Soviet government strengthens large-scale production as against petty production, advanced production as against backward production, and machine production as against hand production. It also obtains a larger quantity of the products of large-scale industry (its share of the output), and strengthens state regulated economic relations as against the anarchy of petty-bourgeois relations. </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Lenin goes further in a different text, from the Third Congress of the Communist international: </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Within the limits indicated, however, this is not at all dangerous for socialism as long as transport and large-scale industry remain in the hands of the proletariat. <strong>On the contrary, the development of capitalism, controlled and regulated by the proletarian state (i.e., “state” capitalism in this sense of the term), is advantageous and necessary in an extremely devastated and backward small-peasant country (within certain limits, of course), inasmuch as it is capable of hastening the immediate revival of peasant farming.</strong> This applies still more to concessions: without denationalising anything, the workers’ state leases certain mines, forest tracts, oilfields, and so forth, to foreign capitalists in order to obtain from them extra equipment and machinery that will enable us to accelerate the restoration of Soviet large-scale industry…</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>4.) How in the world is state capitalism compatible with socialism??</strong></p>

      <p>Lenin answers:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Can the Soviet state and the dictatorship of the proletariat be combined with state capitalism? Are they compatible?</p>

        <p><strong>Of course they are.</strong> This is exactly what I argued in May 1918. I hope I had proved it then. <strong>I had also proved that state capitalism is a step forward compared with the small proprietor (both small-patriarchal and petty-bourgeois) element.</strong> Those who compare state capitalism only with socialism commit a host of mistakes, for in the present political and economic circumstances it is essential to compare state capitalism also with petty-bourgeois production.</p>

        <p>Capitalism is a bane compared with socialism. Capitalism is a boon compared with medievalism, small production, and the evils of bureaucracy which spring from the dispersal of the small producers. Inasmuch as we are as yet unable to pass directly from small production to socialism, <strong>some capitalism is inevitable as the elemental product of small production and exchange; so that we must utilise capitalism (particularly by directing it into the channels of state capitalism) as the intermediary link between small production and socialism, as a means, a path, and a method of increasing the productive forces.</strong></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The transition from capitalism to socialism through state capitalism produces the materials and conditions necessary to sustain a society’s economy and population, while steering away capitalists that attempt to exploit and take advantage of the workers. </p>

      <p><strong>5.) What does all of this have to do with SWCC?</strong></p>

      <p>Despite Lenin’s words about the inevitability of using capitalism to create the production necessary to sustain socialism, his New Economic Policy or “state capitalism” was justified as a temporary measure to kick start the economy after several wars and sabotages. <strong>But if it was only to be used as a temporary measure to jump start the USSR’s economy after the ravages of war, why does China take decades to develop its own productive forces?</strong>This is where Deng Xiaoping, and his 1978 Reform and Opening Up policy comes in. Welcome to Socialism <em>with Chinese Characteristics.</em></p>

      <p>Mao states the following: </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>"The present-day capitalist economy in China is a capitalist economy which for the most part is under the control of the People's Government and which is linked with the state-owned socialist economy in various forms and supervised by the workers. It is not an ordinary but a particular kind of capitalist economy, namely, a state-capitalist economy of a new type. It exists not chiefly to make profits for the capitalists but to meet the needs of the people and the state. True, a share of the profits produced by the workers goes to the capitalists, but that is only a small part, about one quarter, of the total. The remaining three quarters are produced for the workers (in the form of the welfare fund), for the state (in the form of income tax) and for expanding productive capacity (a small part of which produces profits for the capitalists). Therefore, this state-capitalist economy of a new type takes on a socialist character to a very great extent and benefits the workers and the state."</p>

      <p>Professor Roland Boer is a distinguished author and professor of philosophy at the Renmin University of China. <a href="https://stalinsmoustache.org/2019/09/16/on-state-capitalism/#_ftnref4">He was able to connect everything mentioned from Lenin’s text above to what Deng Xiaoping to further his New Economic Policy</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span>: </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>This brings us to the fourth direction arising from Lenin’s work, concerning which I need to mention Chinese scholarship. <strong>These scholars have pointed out that part of the inspiration for Deng Xiaoping’s breakthrough with the Reform and Opening Up was precisely Lenin’s New Economic Policy…</strong> </p>

        <p>[A]s we look back after a century, we can see certain shortcomings in Lenin’s approach. <strong>Notably, he assumed that private enterprise and market exchange were by definition capitalist, while public ownership and a planned economy were necessarily socialist. We now know that this is not the case, for market economies have existed under many different – and non-capitalist – conditions.</strong> At the same time, <strong>Lenin did make the crucial point that everything depends on the underlying system within which a market economy works…</strong> It would be better to speak of a market economy as a component of a larger socialist system. <em>Let me emphasize that this point is not made by foreign scholars, since they tend not to use Chinese sources for their work.</em></p>

        <p>To sum up, state capitalism has an intriguing and complex history, with its initial development in the Marxist tradition through Lenin, its subsequent misuse by a number of Western Marxists in relation to the Soviet Union and China, its redeployment (without knowledge of the Marxist tradition) to try and understand the turn away from the neoliberal project, its Leninist sense by a small number of Marxists in relation to China, and then <strong>Chinese scholarship that fully acknowledges Lenin’s influence on Deng Xiaoping but then takes his insights a significant step further.</strong></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Deng emphasized the importance of the underlying system that controls the market. Despite his opening up policy, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/damwvj/the_importance_of_ideological_discipline_why_the/">Deng created the four cardinal principles that are not allowed for debate to ensure ideological discipline within the CCP, as they opened up their markets</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span>. Deng elongated the transitional period Lenin emphasized, while utilizing state capitalist principles to ensure a stable pathway towards socialism. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>In a country as big and as poor as ours, if we don't try to increase production, how can we survive? How is socialism superior, when our people have so many difficulties in their lives? The Gang of Four clamoured for "poor socialism'' and "poor communism'', declaring that communism was mainly a spiritual thing. That is sheer nonsense! We say that socialism is the first stage of communism. When a backward country is trying to build socialism, it is natural that during the long initial period its productive forces will not be up to the level of those in developed capitalist countries and that it will not be able to eliminate poverty completely. Accordingly, in building socialism we must do all we can to develop the productive forces and gradually eliminate poverty, constantly raising the people's living standards. Otherwise, how will socialism be able to triumph over capitalism? In the second stage, or the advanced stage of communism, when the economy is highly developed and there is overwhelming material abundance, we shall be able to apply the principle of from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. If we don't do everything possible to increase production, how can we expand the economy? How can we demonstrate the superiority of socialism and communism? We have been making revolution for several decades and have been building socialism for more than three. Nevertheless, by 1978 the average monthly salary for our workers was still only 45 yuan, and most of our rural areas were still mired in poverty. Can this be called the superiority of socialism? That is why I insisted that the focus of our work should be rapidly shifted to economic development. A decision to this effect was made at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and it represented an important turning point. Our practice since then has shown that this line is correct, as the whole country has taken on an entirely new look.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Is this revisionism? Absolutely not. I want to dive into a bit more on how Deng and SWCC expands NEP and state capitalist theory, but don’t have the space for it here. However, I will say Because of SWCC and the relentless leadership of the CCP, China has grown to become the largest economy in the world; eradicate poverty, homelessness, and hunger for its 1.4 billion population; and concentrate its capital, not in corporations or capitalists, but in education, healthcare, technology, workers, and the welfare of its people. The CCP is the largest political party on earth, with 90 million members, and millions of others around the world upholding SWCC. The CCP has extensive control over large private companies, and are not scared of going after capitalists (they recently sentenced a banker to death). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/ehzwv3/china_after_2050_be_patient/">Xi Jingping and the CCP has reiterated again and again their commitment to socialism, especially after modernizing their state and initiating the transition between 2035-2049</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span>. </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>So while China has introduced elements of capitalism in the 40 years since the start of ‘reform and opening up’, these do not constitute a negation of socialism, any more than they did in the New Democracy period in the 1950s, or under the New Economic Policy in the Soviet Union in the 1920s. The point of the reforms is to lay the ground for a more advanced socialism: ”In order to realise communism, we have to accomplish the tasks set in the socialist stage. They are legion, but the fundamental one is to develop the productive forces so as to demonstrate the superiority of socialism over capitalism and provide the material basis for communism.”</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>TLDR: Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is a reflection of Lenin’s state capitalism and new economic policy, elongated, enhanced, and improved by Deng Xiaoping.</strong></p>
