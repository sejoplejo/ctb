      <p>Capitalism and Corona Virus</p>

      <p>For Capitalism, it’s no longer business as usual. The global corona virus pandemic is a living example of Marx’s fundamental point that capitalist relations of production in the form of private property, inevitably strangle, restrain, mutilate and hinder the development of the means of production, ie the productive forces of society. </p>

      <p>“At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or — what is but a legal expression for the same thing — with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution.”<br/>
    Marx.  Preface of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy    </p>

      <p>Marx recognized that economic production is facilitated and developed by science, but that economic distribution is always determined by the social relations between humans – in other words, relations of production. Under capitalism, the relations of production include the ownership of the tools and technology of society by private corporations as private property. They cannot permit the distribution of the social product for free and still make private profit.
So they don’t.</p>

      <p>We are watching this right before our eyes as the US keeps fumbling along. The largest and richest capitalist economy is prevented from mounting a comprehensive public health campaign against the virus. While China’s initial response left much to be desired, the state’s response in Wuhan w had never even been attempted anywhere in previous epidemics. </p>

      <p>A scientific epidemiological approach to disease was rapidly put into place on an unprecedented scale. The entire population self-quarantined for weeks. This impulse lead and legitimated the state response. The government built two giant hospitals in a few days. It sequenced the virus and shared its scientific research with the world. It pioneered testing and the vaccine process. The US response is qualitatively retarded in comparison.</p>

      <p>Vietnam declared a national emergency on January 30 and immediately implemented a powerful, pro-active response:</p>

      <p>“Worldwide, the outbreak has already killed almost 3,000 and infected more than 83,000 as of Saturday. It is a different story, however, in Vietnam. World Health Organization (WHO) officials and health experts said the government's swift response to the emergency was crucial in containing the crisis at the early stage. By Wednesday, the Vietnamese government declared that the 16th and final patient infected with the virus had been discharged from the hospital.”
                        “All infected patients in Vietnam cured: A coronavirus miracle ...”

      <p>The attached articles concretely show how private property, private corporations, private patents, private control of research, private control of science are crippling the US response:</p>

      <p>Dean Baker’s “Patents Are Slowing the Development of a Coronavirus Vaccine” 
    - truthout.org/articles/patents-are-slowing-the... </p>

      <p>Stephen Buryani’s “How Profit Makes the Fight for a Coronavirus Vaccine Harder” 
-   <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/04/" rel="nofollow">www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/04/</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span>... </p>

      <p>These contributions are important, but they do not really draw the conclusion:  corporate neglect of very real risks for millions of people is criminal and murderous. </p>

      <p>Actually these are just the most recent examples of how a government controlled by private property will sacrifice humanity on the altar of gold. Similarly the corporate-controlled governments of capitalism are sacrificing the climate since their so-called response is totally controlled by private property.</p>

      <p>In both cases, the only step, the simple step, is to abolish the private control of the means of production. Pharmaceutical corporations, who claim they own the science, the research and the vaccines are screwing up the global response. Petroleum corporations claim the private control of oil and refuse to even limit, much less halt, the production of the oil that results in the CO2 and plastics that are overwhelming the natural processes of Nature.</p>

      <p>A State and a government can always mobilize better than private entities for the simple reason that they do not permit private corporate ownership to get in the way and delay the response. The government had a manufacturing facility to make vaccines for the military at pennies a pop… until the 1990s. </p>

      <p>Technology Review says it all: “Should the Government Make Vaccines?  ---  Vaccine shortages could have the United States on the brink of a public health disaster. Federal health organizations are pushing for nationalized vaccine production, but industry says no.”
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/401423/should-the-government-make-vaccines/" rel="nofollow">https://www.technologyreview.com/s/401423/should-the-government-make-vaccines/</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>Actually, capitalism has no problem creating vaccines… for pets and farm animals. They can make big money off of these. But poor people cannot pay for profitable medicines, so there it is. No market. </p>

      <p>We are being shown once again that a law of capitalism cannot eliminate a law of Nature: germs are the most democratic organisms there are. </p>

      <p>It is not so far-fetched for the US suddenly sweep homeless encampments across the country as “disease reservoirs”, eliminating homelessness by eliminating the homeless. Locking them away in concentration camps. And what will happen to the concentration camps we already have that are filled with immigrant children?</p>

      <p>Let us remember that when Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine in response to the global pandemic in the 1950s, he gave it away free to the governments of the world. He could have privatized it, but he shared it internationally for free. </p>

      <p>On April 12, 1955, Edward R. Murrow asked Jonas Salk who owned the patent to the polio vaccine. “Well, the people, I would say,” Salk responded. “There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?”</p>
