      <p>The Corona Virus has undeniably been one of the largest crises faced by the capitalist system within recent memory. Western nations have responded to it in a variety of ways, the majority of which are complete failures. The western system is fundamentally unable to deal with the crisis not because of the corruption of a functioning system but systemic issues and the overall failures of capitalism.</p>

      <p>Failure to Contain</p>

      <p>The first response taken by western nations is usually to downplay the severity of Corona rhetoric such as “it's weaker than the flu” or “It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear,” Unfortunately for Capitalism viruses don't just disappear! Western nations have almost all chosen to maximize short term profits over preparing for the virus while simultaneously utilizing intelligence assets to smear the Chinese government's handling of the issues.</p>

      <p>The brave actions taken by the Communist Party bought Western nations more than enough time to prepare for the crisis, but this was largely squandered by Western nations. America, the leader of the First World, failed to even develop test kits in time. I predict that someone will become very rich in America despite already developed kits being used in other nations. The delayed response and failure to develop test kits are two of the largest reasons for the spread of Corona within the United States. This is largely in contrast to the approach taken in China. Immediate strictly-enforced quarantine at the expense of short term profit allowed China, one of the most populated nations in the world, to quickly control Corona. Currently, America is struggling to even test or quarantine one state when its already spread to multiple.</p>

      <p>Additionally, Western nations are unable to provide masks or protection for their citizens so instead provides false information claiming masks are not helpful. The leaders of western Nations are at best incompetent like Trudeau whose wife got it! At worse leaders of the west are freely allowing it to spread in order to reduce social security payments and weaken the working class in order to later sell a for-profit cure or vaccine. As it stands now Western Nations are willing to potentially sacrifice millions of people to fuel the thirst of capitalism.</p>

      <p>Panic and Shortages </p>

      <p>As panic sets in with the spread of Coronavirus, we are shown the absolute lack of preparedness within Western nations for a pandemic. Our hospitals lack surge capabilities likely resulting in countless unnecessary deaths. Our primary method of dealing with increased cases is higher wait times? The myth parroted by westerners to criticize socialized healthcare apparently is just projection. </p>

      <p>Shortages and improper usage of PPE have been apparent from the start. In western nations we are very quickly having to ration off masks even amongst health care workers. Improper usage is also one of the leading reasons for spread here. I highly doubt America's shortage of doctors will be resolved any time soon either, meanwhile the embargoed Cuba has significantly more doctors per capita.</p>

      <p>Economic Failure</p>

      <p>As the Corona virus dies down due to the extreme successes of Chinese quarantine measures the Chinese stock market is doing better while American markets have descended into freefall. Capitalism is inherently unable to deal with a pandemic like Corona. Even if Coronavirus is quickly contained within the USA many people may end up homeless or have much of their life savings wiped away. Workers who get sick may be forced to lose their jobs and healthcare. If the recent stimulus fails to reverse the downturn then there is a high likelihood that the USA will enter into a recession during the beginning phases of Corona. A high amount of newly impoverished Americans during a pandemic is unacceptable. No nation should accept a system that impoverishes its citizens because of bad luck.</p>

      <p>Price gouging is a practice that has become widespread within the western world. Although governments have taken steps to ban price gouging I would like to remind you all that price gouging is just supply and demand capitalism working properly.</p>

      <p>Personal Note/Conclusion</p>

      <p>As an Asian-American born in the United States you hear many claims and attacks made against Asian nations, usually the one of your ancestry from bigoted and racist perspectives. It is important we challenge and look past these assumptions. Through first researching communism and later Mao I have been able to see the world from a wider point of view. I do not necessarily consider myself a Maoist or a follower of Mao Zedong Thought, but I think it is important that people consider other points of view in order to gain a larger picture of current events and to challenge imperialism.</p>

      <p>I write about current events in an academic study but unfortunately will probably be unable to publish anything like this, so yeah. a little more informal of a publishing than I would like.</p>

      <p>The Majority of sources I used probably contain at least a little Sinophobia. It was a struggle to find ones that didn’t and were quality.</p>

      <p>I do not think China's response was perfect per say but I believe steps have been made to improve the response and so far it’s the best. </p>
