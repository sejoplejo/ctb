    abstract = { This article analyzes the widely held assumption in academia and the mainstream press that capitalism has proven superior to socialism in responding to human needs. The author surveys the health conditions of the world's populations, continent by continent, and shows that, contrary to dominant ideology, socialism and socialist forces have been, for the most part, better able to improve health conditions than have capitalism and capitalist forces. In the underdeveloped world, socialist forces and regimes have, more frequently than not, improved health and social indicators better than capitalist forces and regimes, and in the developed world, countries with strong socialist forces have been better able to improve health conditions than those countries lacking or with weak socialist forces. The socialist experience has, of course, also included negative developments that have negated important components of the socialist project. Still, the evidence presented in this article shows that the historical experience of socialism has not been one of failure. To the contrary: it has been, for the most part, more successful than capitalism in improving the health conditions of the world's populations. }

    abstract = { This article investigates the impact of selected political and economic processes on the well-being of domestic populations within samples of 50 to 84 peripheral and noncore nations. Existing research by Cereseto and Waitzkin on the relative merits of market versus socialist systems for the provision of health and welfare needs of their populations is extended by employing a more complex model than the original study. More specifically, the authors assess the impact on measures of population health and mortality rates of regime ideology, state strength, multinational corporate penetration, and position in the world economy. In general, high levels of democracy and strong left-wing regimes are associated with positive health outcomes, and strong right-wing regimes have populations with lower life expectancies and higher levels of various measures of mortality. These findings support the conclusion that political systems make a difference in health and well-being independent of national (gross national product per capita) and international (investment dependency) economic factors. }

 abstract = {North Vietnam has for several decades had moderate mortality and moderate fertility at a very low level of income. This pattern emerged during the communist period of the 1950s to 1970s. The communist-era institutions were the fundamental cause of the economic stagnation, but they were well suited to delivering primary health care, and they encouraged better-off families to limit their childbearing. During the 1980s and 1990s the communist economic institutions disintegrated, and Vietnam's political and economic systems came increasingly to resemble those of its authoritarian capitalist neighbors. Incomes have risen quickly, from a low base, and mortality and fertility have continued to cdecline. The new institutions have delivered rapid economic grouwth but are not so well suited to providing primary health care; declining efficiency in the health sector appears, however, to have been offset by increases in available resources. The new institutions, like the old, encourage limited childbearing, and the government has developed an extensive birth control program.},

    abstract = { This analysis reflects on the importance of political parties, and the policies they implement when in government, in determining the level of equalities/inequalities in a society, the extent of the welfare state (including the level of health care coverage by the state), the employment/unemployment rate, and the level of population health. The study looks at the impact of the major political traditions in the advanced OECD countries during the golden years of capitalism (1945–1980)–social democratic, Christian democratic, liberal, and ex-fascist–in four areas: (1) the main determinants of income inequalities; (2) levels of public expenditures and health care benefits coverage; (3) public support of services to families; and (4) the level of population health as measured by infant mortality. The results indicate that political traditions more committed to redistributive policies (both economic and social) and full-employment policies, such as the social democratic parties, were generally more successful in improving the health of populations. The erroneous assumption of a conflict between social equity and economic efficiency is also discussed. The study aims at filling a void in the growing health and social inequalities literature, which rarely touches on the importance of political forces in influencing inequalities. }

    abstract = { There is increasing evidence supporting the existence of a link between income inequalities and health outcomes. The main purpose of this article is to test whether economic inequalities are associated with poor population health in Latin American countries. Multi-country data from 1970 to 2012 were used to assess this question. The results show that the Gini coefficient has a strong correlation with health outcomes. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis using fixed effects shows that after controlling for gross national income per capita, literacy rate, and health expenditure, the Gini coefficient is independently negatively associated with health outcomes. In Latin American countries, for every percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient, the infant mortality rate grows by 0.467 deaths per 1,000 live births, holding all other variables constant. Additionally, an ordinary least squares estimation model suggests that countries that do not use International Monetary Fund loans perform better on health outcomes. These findings should alert policymakers, elected officials, and the public of the need to fight income inequalities and rethink the role of international financial institutions that dictate state policies. }
