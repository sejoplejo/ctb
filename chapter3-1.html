      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

      <p>The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was the first nation ever to declare itself a socialist state, dedicated to the building of communism. Over the seven decades of its existence, the USSR went through many stages and phases of development, from a semi-capitalist feudal society, to a state capitalist nation during the NEP years, to a developed socialist country, and finally to a revisionist state regressing towards capitalism. The purpose of this post is to examine the achievements of socialism in the USSR up to the early 1960's, at which point market reforms and capitalist restoration began to take effect. We will also be examining the disastrous effects that these reforms had on the health and well-being of the Soviet people.</p>

      <p>This post will consist of three parts. This first part is a discussion of the achievements of Soviet socialism in terms of economic development, living standards, and healthcare. The question of Stalin and the Ukrainian famine will also be discussed. The second part will be a discussion of Soviet advances in women's rights, as well as opposition to racism (both internally, and in its global manifestation of imperialism). We will also discuss the nature of Soviet democracy. The third part will discuss the eventual fall of the USSR, and the disastrous effects of capitalist restoration and revisionism in the USSR.</p>

      <p>All sources are listed at the end of the post. I will indicate which source I am using each time I quote from one. Now, let us begin.</p>

      <p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Revolution, War Communism, and the NEP -</strong></p>

      <p>When the 1917 revolution took place, Russia was a backwards, semi-capitalist feudal society. The manor system had only recently been abolished, and replaced by the most brutal and primitive form of capitalism. The nation was dreadfully under-developed, with no sign of improving in the future. Not only that, but what little growth did occur led to massive inequalities. According to Professor <a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/social-science/faculty/robert-allen.html">Robert Allen</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span> (formerly of Oxford University, now at NYU):</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Not only were the bases of Imperial advance narrow, but the process of growth gave rise to such inequitable changes in income distribution that revolution was hardly a surprise. Real wages for urban workers were static in the late Imperial period despite a significant increase in output per worker.... The revolution was also a peasant revolt, and the interests of the peasants were different... As in the cities, there was no gain in real wages.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><a href="https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/%7Esyrbe/">Simon Clarke</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span>, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Warwick, supports these claims:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Agriculture had reached North American levels of productivity by 1913 and wheat prices collapsed after 1914. The expansion of the railroads had run its course and there was no prospect of protected light industry becoming internationally competitive. The appropriate comparators for the prospects for Russian capitalism in the twentieth century are not Japan but Argentina or even India. Moreover, Russian capitalist development had brought little if any benefit to the urban and rural working class, intensifying the class conflicts that erupted in Revolution.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>With the 1917 revolution (and after the bloody civil war, with its policy of war communism), the Soviet economy began to grow rapidly. The New Economic Policy (which nationalized large-scale industry and redistributed land, while allowing for the private sale of agricultural surplus) succeeded in transforming Russia from a semi-capitalist society into a developing state capitalist society, laying the groundwork for socialism. Professor Clarke states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Following War Communism, the New Economic Policy (NEP) sought to develop the Russian economy within a quasi-capitalist framework.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>However, economic circumstances came to require the transition to a planned socialist economy:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>However, the institutional and structural barriers to Russian economic development were now compounded by the unfavorable circumstances of the world economy, so that there was no prospect of export-led development, while low domestic incomes provided only a limited market for domestic industry. Without a state coordinated investment program, the Soviet economy would be caught in the low-income trap typical of the underdeveloped world.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Thus, the material conditions of the time made the transition to a socialist economy a necessity.</p>

      <p><strong>- Economic Development and Living Standards in the Socialist Era -</strong></p>

      <p>In 1928 (after Stalin came to power as head of the Communist Party), Soviet Russia instituted a fully planned economy, and the first Five Year Plan was enacted. This resulted in rapid economic growth. According to Professor Allen:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Soviet GDP increased rapidly with the start of the first Five Year Plan in 1928... The expansion of heavy industry and the use of output targets and soft-budgets to direct firms were appropriate to the conditions of the 1930's, they were adopted quickly, and they led to rapid growth of investment and consumption.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Bourgeois economists often alleged that this rapid growth came at the cost of per-capita consumption and living standards. However, more recent research has shown this to be false. Professor Allen states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>There has been no debate that ‘collective consumption’ (principally education and health services) rose sharply, but the standard view was that private consumption declined. Recent research, however, calls that conclusion into question... While investment certainly increased rapidly, <em>recent research shows that the standard of living also increased briskly.</em></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Calorie consumption rose rapidly during this period:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Calories are the most basic dimension of the standard of living, and their consumption was higher in the late 1930's than in the 1920's... In 1895-1910, calorie availability was only 2100 per day, which is very low by modern standards. By the late 1920's, calorie availability advanced to 2500... By the late 1930's, the recovery of agriculture increased calorie availability to 2900 per day, a significant increase over the late 1920's. The food situation during the Second World War was severe, but by 1970 calorie consumption rose to 3400, which was on a par with western Europe.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Overall, the development of the Soviet economy during the socialist period was extremely impressive. According to Professor Allen:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Soviet economy performed well... Planning led to high rates of capital accumulation, rapid GDP growth, and rising per capita consumption even in the 1930's.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The USSR's growth during the socialist period exceeded that of the capitalist nations:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The USSR led the non-OECD countries and, indeed, achieved a growth rate in this period that exceeded the OECD catch-up regression as well as the OECD average.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This success is also attributed specifically to the revolution and the socialist system. As Professor Allen states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>This success would not have occurred without the 1917 revolution or the planned development of state owned industry.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The benefits of the socialist system are obvious upon closer study. As the Professor Clarke puts it:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>...a capitalist economy would not have created the industrial jobs required to employ the surplus labour, since capitalists would only employ labour so long as the marginal product of labour exceeded the wage. State-sponsored industrialization faced no such constraints, since enterprises were encouraged to expand employment in line with the demands of the plan.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Economic growth was also aided by the liberation of women, and the resulting control over the birth rate, as well as women's participation in the workforce. Allen states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The rapid growth in per capita income was contingent not just on the rapid expansion of GDP but also on the slow growth of the population. This was primarily due to a rapid fertility transition rather than a rise in mortality from collectivization, political repression, or the Second World War. Falling birth rates were primarily due to the education and employment of women outside the home. These policies, in turn, were the results of enlightenment ideology in its communist variant.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Reviews of Allen's work have backed up his statements. According to the Professor Clarke:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Allen shows that the Stalinist strategy worked, in strictly economic terms, until around 1970... Allen’s book convincingly establishes the superiority of a planned over a capitalist economy in conditions of labour surplus (which is the condition of most of the world most of the time).</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Other studies have backed-up the findings that the USSR's living standards rose rapidly. According to Professor <a href="https://www.ebrainerd.com/">Elizabeth Brainerd</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span> (formerly of Williams College, now at Brandeis University):</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Remarkably large and rapid improvements in child height, adult stature and infant mortality were recorded from approximately 1945 to 1970...  Both Western and Soviet estimates of GNP growth in the Soviet Union indicate that GNP per capita grew in every decade in the postwar era, at times far surpassing the growth rates of the developed western economies... The conventional measures of GNP growth and household consumption indicate a long, uninterrupted upward climb in the Soviet standard of living from 1928 to 1985; even Western estimates of these measures support this view, albeit at a slower rate of growth than the Soviet measures.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Unfortunately, after the introduction of market reforms and other revisionist policies, living standards began to deteriorate (although some measures continued to increase, albeit more slowly). According to Professor Brainerd:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Three different measures of population health show a consistent and large improvement between approximately 1945 and 1969: child height, adult height and infant mortality all improved significantly during this period. These three biological measures of the standard of living also corroborate the evidence of some deterioration in living conditions beginning around 1970, when infant and adult mortality were rising and child and adult height stopped increasing and in some regions began to decline.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Economic growth also began to slow around this time. According to Professor Allen:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>After the Second World War, the Soviet economy resumed rapid growth. By 1970, the growth rate was sagging, and per capita output was static by 1985.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The Cold War was another factor which contributed to slowing growth rates:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The Cold War was an additional factor that lowered Soviet growth after 1968. The creation of high tech weaponry required a disproportionate allocation of R &amp; D personnel and resources to the military. Innovation in civilian machinery and products declined accordingly. Half of the decreased in the growth rate of per capita GDP was due to the decline in productivity growth, and that decrease provides an upper bound to the impact of the arms race with the United States.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>In short, the USSR achieved massively positive economic results until the 1970's, when revisionist policies and the Cold War began to cause a stagnation. Now, let us move on from economic development, and talk about the health standards of the Soviet population.</p>

      <p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Healthcare Conditions in the Socialist Period -</strong></p>

      <p>Health conditions in Czarist Russia had been deplorable; it was among the unhealthiest nations in Europe (arguably in the entire world). According to Professor Reiner Dinkel (University of Munich):</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Without doubt the Soviet Union was one of the most underdeveloped European countries at the time of the October Revolution. In terms of life-expectancy it lagged behind the other industrialized countries of Europe by a gap of about 15 years.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>However, after the socialist revolution, healthcare conditions began to increase rapidly. By the end of the socialist period, healthcare standards (measured by life expectancy and mortality rates) were superior to those of Western Europe and the USA. Professor Dinkel states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>One of the most striking advances of socialism has been and was generally seen to be the improvement in public health provision for the population as a whole. In accordance with this assumption mortality-rates in the Soviet Union declined rapidly in the first two decades after World War II. In 1965 life-expectancy for men and women in all parts of the Soviet Union, which still included vast underdeveloped regions with unfavorable living conditions, were as high or even higher than in the United States. Such a development fits perfectly into the picture of emerging industrial development and generally improving conditions of living.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Even reactionary intellectuals were forced to acknowledge these achievements; according to Nicholas Ebserstadt (a conservative think-tank adviser), healthcare standards in the Soviet Union during the socialist period surpassed those of the USA and Western Europe:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Over much of this century the nation in the vanguard of the revolution in health was the Soviet Union. In 1897 Imperial Russia offered its people a life expectancy of perhaps thirty years. In European Russia, from what we can make out, infant mortality (that is, death in the first year) claimed about one child in four, and in Russia’s Asian hinterlands the toll was probably closer to one in three. Yet by the late 1950's the average Soviet citizen could expect to live 68.7 years: longer than his American counterpart, who had begun the century with a seventeen-year lead. By 1960 the Soviet infant mortality rate, higher than any in Europe as late as the Twenties, was lower than that of Italy, Austria, or East Germany, and seemed sure to undercut such nations as Belgium and West Germany any year.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>He even notes that these achievements made socialism seem nearly unbeatable:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>In the face of these and other equally impressive material accomplishments, Soviet claims about the superiority of their “socialist” system, its relevance to the poor countries, and the inevitability of its triumph over the capitalist order were not easily refuted.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>While health conditions did start to decline after the introduction of revisionist policies in the mid-60's (this will be discussed in more detail in part three), the healthcare achievements of the socialist system remain unimpeachable.</p>

      <p><strong>- The Question of Stalin -</strong></p>

      <p>(EDIT: An <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/e8kpow/masterpost_on_joseph_stalin_and_the_great_purge/">entire masterpost on this topic</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span> has been prepared, with more extensive sources and detail. I recommend going there instead for a more in-depth and detailed look at this issue.)</p>

      <p>Joseph Stalin was the principal architect of the socialist period in the USSR. As a result, he has been the victim of perhaps the most extensive smear campaign in modern history. Claims that he killed tens of millions of people, jailed victims without cause, and deliberately starved Ukrainian peasants are only some of the propaganda charges leveled against him. As such, it is the duty of any informed socialist to combat this propaganda.</p>

      <p>Firstly, we must remember the extensive achievements discussed above, which vastly improved life for hundreds of millions of people. These achievements were the result of the socialist system, built primarily under Joseph Stalin. Even reactionaries have been unable to deny this. According to the right-wing commentator Nicholas Ebserstadt:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Stalin's results were incontestable. This is a point those of us in the West often overlook. Stalin inherited a country that was the primary casualty of World War I, and bequeathed to his successors a super-power. It is but a single measure of the success of the ‘Leader’, and his understanding of the endurance of his nation, that between 1940 and 1953... the USSR doubled its production of coal and steel, tripled its output of cement and industrial goods, and increased its pool of skilled labor by a factor of ten<em>.</em> These rates of growth were geometrically higher than in the less devastated and Terror-free West.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Now, let us discuss some of the particular issue relating to Stalin.</p>

      <p><strong>- The Great Purge -</strong></p>

      <p>The purges of the late-1930's are a definite black mark on the legacy of Soviet socialism; this much cannot be denied. That being said, they have been the subject of decades-worth of unjustified and intolerable distortions and exaggerations by bourgeois academics, necessitating a thorough reply.</p>

      <p>Firstly, let us establish the facts of how many people actually died in the purges. While Westerners are often treated to numbers ranging from 20 to 50 million, the true figures (while bad enough in their own right) are nowhere near that high. According to Professor <a href="https://history.ucla.edu/faculty/j-arch-getty">J. Arch Getty</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5]" title="press 5 to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>From 1921 to Stalin's death, in 1953, around 800,000 people were sentenced to death and shot, 85 percent of them in the years of the Great Terror of 1937-1938. From 1934 to Stalin's death, more than a million perished in the gulag camps.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>To these figures must be added an important qualification: contrary to popular opinion, the vast majority of gulag inmates were not innocent political prisoners. Professor Getty notes that those convicted of "counterrevolutionary crimes" made up between 12 and 33 percent (depending on the year) of the gulag population, with the rest having been convicted of ordinary crimes. He also rejects the common claim that non-Russian nationalities were disproportionately targeted. To quote from his article in the <em>American Historical Review:</em></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The long-awaited archival evidence on repression in the period of the Great Purges shows that the levels of arrests, political prisoners, executions, and general camp populations tend to confirm the orders of magnitude indicated by those labeled as "revisionists" and mocked by those proposing high estimates... inferences that the terror fell particularly hard on non-Russian nationalities are not borne out by the camp population data from the 1930's. The frequent assertion that most of the camp prisoners were 'political' also seems not to be true.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>These figures are confirmed in a <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80T00246A032000400001-1.pdf">CIA report on the topic</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span>.</p>

      <p>In addition, the gulag camps were not death camps like those of the Nazis; they were prisons, albeit harsh ones. Even noted anti-communist scholars (such as those who worked on the infamous <em>Black Book of Communism</em>) have admitted this. To quote again from Professor Getty:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Stalin's camps were different from Hitler's. Tens of thousands of prisoners were released every year upon completion of their sentences. We now know that before World War II more inmates escaped annually from the Soviet camps than died there. [...]  Werth, a well-regarded French specialist on the Soviet Union whose sections in the <em>Black Book</em> on the Soviet Communists are sober and damning, told <em>Le Monde,</em> "Death camps did not exist in the Soviet Union."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>It must also be noted that, contrary to the popular conception of Stalin's USSR as a place of "total terror" (to quote Hannah Arendt), the majority of the population did not feel threatened by the purges. Referring to the time of the Great Purge, Professor <a href="http://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/history/about/faculty/emeriti-faculty/thurston/index.html">Robert Thurston</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[7]" title="press 7 to open link"></span> notes that "my evidence suggests that widespread fear did not exist in the case at hand." He also notes that the Great Purge was an exceptional occurrence, which cannot be used to characterize the Stalinist-era as a whole:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>I will not simply imply but will state outright that the <em>Ezhovshchina</em> (Great Purge) was an aberration. Torture was uncommon until August 1937, when it became the norm; it ended abruptly with Beria's rise to head of the NKVD in late 1938. Mass arrests followed the same pattern... A campaign for more regular, fair, and systemic judicial procedures that began in 1933-1934 was interrupted and overwhelmed by the Terror in 1937. It resumed in the spring of 1938, more strongly and effectively than before. Thus more than one trend was broken by the <em>Ezhovshchina</em>, only to reappear after it.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>He also points out that some arrests which took place during the Great Purge were based on previously-ignored (yet arguably still legitimate) crimes against the Soviet state, such as fighting with the reactionary forces during the Civil War:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>People were suddenly arrested in 1937 for things that had happened many years earlier but had been ignored since, for example, serving in a White army.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The question arises: why arrest former White Army soldiers, among others? The answer lies in the general fear of counterrevolution which pervaded the party at this time. According to Professor <a href="https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/history/staff/64/professor-james-harris">James Harris</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[8]" title="press 8 to open link"></span>:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>By the mid-1930's, the rise of the Nazis in Germany and the militarists in Japan, both stridently anti-communist, posed a very real threat to the USSR. War was then on the horizon, and Stalin felt he had no choice but to take preemptive action against what he saw as a potential fifth column – a group that would undermine the larger collective.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Remember that since the moment of its founding (still a recent event, at this time), the Soviet Union had been <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-i/the-day-that-the-usa-invaded-russia-and-fought-with-the-red-army-x.html">invaded by multiple capitalist powers</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[9]" title="press 9 to open link"></span> (including the United States) in the early-1920's, and had also been subject to espionage and internal sabotage. Combined with the looming threat of war with an increasingly powerful Nazi Germany, it is hardly surprising that these factors came together to form an atmosphere of paranoia, which lent itself to the sort of violent excess seen during the Purge. This coincides with Professor Thurston's interpretation of the events, from his book <em>Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia:</em></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>...between 1934 and 1936 police and court practice relaxed significantly. Then a series of events, together with the tense international situation and memories of real enemy activity during the savage Russian Civil War, combined to push leaders and people into a hysterical hunt for perceived 'wreckers.' After late 1938, however, the police and courts became dramatically milder.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>This general atmosphere of fear (not of the purges, but of external and internal enemies) is most likely why the majority of the Soviet people seemed to support the government's actions during the Purge period. According to Professor Thurston:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>The various reactions to arrest cataloged above suggest that general fear did not exist in the USSR at any time in the late 1930's... People who remained at liberty often felt that some event in the backgrounds of the detained individuals justified their arrests. The sense that anyone could be next, the underpinning of theoretical systems of terror, rarely appears.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Overall, perhaps the most succinct summary of this issue is the one provided in Professor Thurston's book, in which he states:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>There was never a long period of Stalinism without a serious foreign threat, major internal dislocation, or both, which makes identifying its true nature impossible.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>As Marxists, we should be well aware that material conditions shape ideological and political structures. The savagery of the Russian Civil War, the multiple invasions from capitalist powers, and the increasing threat of a war against fascism make the paranoid atmosphere of the late-1930's understandable, if not condonable; yet even while we discuss the genuine causes of the Purge, and reject the hysterical anti-communist mud-throwing of the Cold Warriors, we must still acknowledge the black mark that the Purge leaves on Stalin's legacy.</p>

      <p><strong>- The Ukrainian Famine -</strong></p>

      <p>Perhaps the most pernicious accusation against Stalin is that he orchestrated the dreadful famine of the early-1930's in order to squash a Ukrainian nationalist revolt. This despicable slander (which is peddled largely by Ukrainian nationalist and neo-fascist groups) is easily refuted by examining the historical consensus. The following quotes are compiled in an article from the <em>Village Voice</em>, cited below.</p>

      <p><a href="https://creees.stanford.edu/events/alexander-dallin-lecture-russian-east-european-and-eurasian-affairs">Alexander Dallin</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[10]" title="press 0 to open link"></span> of Stanford University writes:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>There is no evidence it was intentionally directed against Ukrainians... that would be totally out of keeping with what we know -- it makes no sense.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>

        <p>This is crap, rubbish... I am an anti-Stalinist, but I don't see how this [genocide] campaign adds to our knowledge. It's adding horrors, adding horrors, until it becomes a pathology.</p>

      <p><a href="https://history.utoronto.ca/people/lynne-viola">Lynne Viola</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[12]" title="press . then 12 and Enter to open link"></span> of the University of Toronto writes:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>I absolutely reject it... Why in god's name would this paranoid government consciously produce a famine when they were terrified of war [with Germany]?</p>

      <p><a href="https://history.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty/mark-b-tauger">Mark Tauger</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[13]" title="press . then 13 and Enter to open link"></span>, Professor of History at West Virginia University (reviewing work by <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/individuals/professor-stephen-wheatcroft">Stephen Wheatcroft</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[14]" title="press . then 14 and Enter to open link"></span> and <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gov/davies-bob.aspx">R.W. Davies</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[15]" title="press . then 15 and Enter to open link"></span>) has this to say:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Popular media and most historians for decades have described the great famine that struck most of the USSR in the early 1930s as “man-made,” very often even a “genocide” that Stalin perpetrated intentionally against Ukrainians and sometimes other national groups to destroy them as nations... This perspective, however, is wrong. The famine that took place was not limited to Ukraine or even to rural areas of the USSR, it was not fundamentally or exclusively man-made, and it was far from the intention of Stalin and others in the Soviet leadership to create such as disaster. A small but growing literature relying on new archival documents and a critical approach to other sources has shown the flaws in the “genocide” or “intentionalist” interpretation of the famine and has developed an alternative interpretation.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>More recent research has discovered natural causes for the Ukrainian famine. Tauger notes:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>...the USSR experienced an unusual environmental disaster in 1932: extremely wet and humid weather that gave rise to severe plant disease infestations, especially rust. Ukraine had double or triple the normal rainfall in 1932. Both the weather conditions and the rust spread from Eastern Europe, as plant pathologists at the time documented. Soviet plant pathologists in particular estimated that rust and other fungal diseases reduced the potential harvest in 1932 by almost nine million tons, which is the largest documented harvest loss from any single cause in Soviet history.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>It should be noted that this does not excuse the Soviet state from any and all responsibility for the suffering that took place; one could accuse the government of insufficiently rapid response, and note that initial reports were often downplayed to avoid rocking the boat. But it is clear that the famine was not deliberate, was not a genocide, and (to quote Tauger) "was not fundamentally or exclusively man-made."</p>

      <p>- <strong>Conclusion -</strong></p>

      <p>During its socialist period, the Soviet Union made some of the most impressive achievements in modern history. The socialist system transformed a nation of illiterate and half-starved peasants into a superpower, with one of the fastest growing economies on Earth, one of the world's best-educated and healthiest populations, and some of the most impressive industrial and technological achievements to date. It provided a model for the oppressed people's of the world to follow, as was shown in China, Cuba, Vietnam, and many other nations.</p>

      <p>In part two, we will examine Soviet advances in women's rights and anti-racism, as well as the Soviet role in global anti-imperialist struggle. We will also examine the governance structure, learn about Soviet democracy, and debunk the claim that the USSR was a "totalitarian state".</p>
