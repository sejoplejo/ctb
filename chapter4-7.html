      <p>This can be a megathread, Round 2 on the Hong Kong (HK) protests, but the mainstream community (especially on Reddit) is hypocritical, nonsensical, and war-hawkish. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/cpiaq0/disturbing_video_taken_in_shenzhen_just_across/">They are just waiting for a "Tiananmen-like" massacre to happen</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span>, while the government has done everything they can to preserve peace and have respected the Special Administrative Regional Status. The amount of white savior complexes out there is incredibly high and promoting this BS. HK protesters know this. They are using this to their advantage by their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cmqdl5/citizens_of_hong_kong_flying_american_flags_in/">Waiving American Flags.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span>; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/">signs made in English.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span>; and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYWuLoAYrgE">singing the mother fucking US national anthem</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div>.</p>

      <p>If you want to witness the epitome of mainstream media failure, just see how shallow their coverage of the HK protests are. Same shit they've done to Venezuela. Only this time, they have a stronger agenda and target: China. China, even among the left, is a controversial government to say the least, but it is because of this weakness in our ranks, they pounce on it. It may not be another "brown" country the US can invade, but the same racism, bigotry, shallowness, and imperialist agenda loves to narrate on. </p>

      <p>With all this said, this will be more of a rhetoric based rant, since we all had our fair share of resources megathreads regarding this topic (however, I will sprinkle some resources to back most of my claims here). </p>

      <p>&gt; <strong>Liberal Arguments and Rebuttals</strong> </p>

      <p><strong>1. There are some leftist who support HK, and Marxist who criticize China's authoritarian rule.</strong></p>

      <p>China's authoritarian rule has been blown up way out of proportion for the benefit of Western propaganda. From the Chinese revolution, to the Cultural revolution, all the way down to Tiananmen Square, Westerners, radlibs, and others in the left LOVE to gobble up Western propaganda to either go against China, or become communist apologists. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/wiki/debunk#wiki_section_2.3A_the_people.27s_republic_of_china">For more information on how this is all propaganda, I highly recommend readers to check out r/communism sources on their Debunk page, section 2: the people's republic of China</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5]" title="press 5 to open link"></span>. Also, I have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/c2b7ma/china_megathread_everything_a_leftist_must_know/">written extensively on all the falsehoods on China, promoted by the West (even by some leftists), including their working conditions, social credit system, Uyghurs camps, Tiananmen square, and (the most ludicrous in my opinion) Falun Gong Organ Harvesting</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://palladiummag.com/2019/05/31/xi-jinping-in-translation-chinas-guiding-ideology/">After reading all the materials regarding China, the one piece of literature that convinced me to fully support the PRC was President Xi Jinping's "Uphold and Develop Socialism with Chinese Characteristics", where he described this rift between leftists and China, and the steadfast economic rise and success they have despite of it. I highly recommend leftist from all sects to read it</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[7]" title="press 7 to open link"></span>. </p>

      <p>I am going to be extremely generous here. Let's say there are leftist, marxist, or even communist groups in HK that are advocating for independence. Let's say they have strong theories, praxis, and reasons as to why independence will be great for the masses and what not. Hell, I will go so far to say that they are 100% independent, not using any Western funding, backing, or influences for their stance (I think we are really in fantasy land here, but let's give it to them).</p>

      <p>THEY ARE STILL A MINORITY. I have already shown you the list of 37,000 NGOs in HK that receive money from the corrupt NED organization, State Department, and CIA. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/TheCrypticMan/hong-kong-protests/wiki/2019%20attempted%20'Black%20Revolution'#markdown-header-foreign-meddling-and-involvement-in-the-protests">The overwhelming amount of HK leaders and organizers meeting with US officials, along with funding, supplying, and sponsoring protests from the West</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[8]" title="press 8 to open link"></span> drowns any real chance of leftist actually promoting the working people's agenda. Does any leftist honestly think that an independent HK would allow any sort of socialism or Marxism in their country?</p>

      <p>We can no longer ignore the semantics of China. They are an economic threat to the West. These tensions are planned. We can argue about the correct measures to help our comrades, while understanding why there may be some measures to protect the CCP, revolution, and their people. But to fall to the West's propaganda and allow its Orientalist narrative to take root in our perspectives against China is unacceptable. They are our comrades. They are closer to our ideals than any capitalist country in the West. The enemy of our enemy, is not our friend. Without the proper diligence, we may be aligning ourselves with the true oppressor (US, CIA ,etc.), rather than those fighting against them (established socialist countries that have overthrown capitalism and are on their pathway towards socialism).  </p>

      <p><strong>2. HK deserves to be independent!</strong></p>

      <p>There are many things wrong with this statement. Hong Kong HEAVILY relies on China for its own financial stability, despite its gigantic economic inequality. <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-think-the-current-unrest-in-Hong-Kong-will-turn-out-in-the-longer-term/answer/Robin-Daverman">55% of Hong Kong’s trade and 80% of its tourists are from mainland China... Hong Kong’s GDP growth slowed down a bit, but by 2017 it was back on track. Then it was hit by the trade war with the Anglo countries, which is a bigger deal than the local unrest...</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[9]" title="press 9 to open link"></span></p>

      <p>&gt; "Hong Kong people want money but are allergic to work, want democracy but are allergic to sharing. want to be respected but refuse to care about anybody else."</p>

      <p>If HK protesters were not waiving imperialist flags, or even, taking another step, REFUSING/REBUKING the aid of the West for its independence, I believe this ENTIRE conversation will be vastly different. If this was the case, communist would really analyze how China may deal with this problem internally. </p>

      <p>But this is not the case. The fingerprints of the CIA and US state department (along with GB and other Western counter parts) are all over this, at the most convenient time at the height of a trade war. Proof of this includes (but not limited to): </p>

      </ul>

      <p>The People being used as a pawn for America's political gain against China. To be used like this is to do the imperialist bidding, as the US seeks to drastically influence and prop up this region through any means necessary. <strong>I can only imagine if China states it will allow HK to be independent, and then the US will HEAVILY support its development for influence to the point where Taiwan, Macau, Tibet, and Xiongnu will want to separate, and become capitalist puppets as well (talk about Domino Theory).</strong></p>

      <p>If you are focusing more on HK than you are on India, you've been duped. If you are praising what these protesters are doing, while lam-blasting BLM, you've been duped. If you think there are no parallels between Venezuela and HK, you have absolutely no idea how imperialism works and should not be involved with this discussion at all. </p>

      <p><strong>3. HK should have its democracy back!</strong></p>

      <p>Back? From what point in history did HK ever had democracy under British rule? British imperialism was absolutely worse than what they have now. A quick history lesson is necessary to fully rebut this statement. Now this is from an academic paper that lists out these atrocious laws while Hong Kong was under British Rule: </p>

      <ul>

        <li>

          <p>Laws were passed to ensure that no Chinese would live in the most desirable areas in Hong Kong, which the British wished to preserve as their exclusive enclaves. </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>In a land in which ninety-eight percent of the population was Chinese, English was the official language. The Chinese language was not permitted to be used in government offices. Laws regulating conduct were written exclusively in English, a language which the vast majority of the population could not understand.</p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>The British unleashed a horrid opioid epidemic on the Chinese through Hong Kong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Tmi7JN3LkA?t=34">Here is a clip of Professor Michael Parenti stating "when the communist liberated Shanghai from the sponsored Kumintang reactionary government, in 1949, about 20% of the population of Shanghai, 1.2 million people, were drug addicts."</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[16]" title="press . then 16 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div>. </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>"The slave trade was merciful compared with the opium trade. We did not destroy the body of the Africans, for it was our immediate interest to keep them alive; we did not debase their natures, corrupt their minds, nor destroy their souls. But the opium sellers lays the body after he has corrupted, degraded and annihilated the moral being of unhappy sinners."</p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>The more fucked up part about this was that the Chinese government seized some of the opium and destroyed it. But after the opium wars, they were forced to compensate the very people that were poisoning their country ($6 million). </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>"The highest level British official in China in the late 1840s described Hong Kong as the “great receptacle of thieves and pirates protected by the technicalities of British law.”</p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p><strong>"Hong Kong has been Chinese Territory since ancient times.</strong> This is a fact known to all, old and young in the world.... British imperialism came to china by pirate ships, provoked the criminal "opium war", massacred numerous Chinese people, and occupied the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.... It is the British imperialist who have come from thousands of miles away to seize our land by force and kill our compatriots" </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>Sex slavery was a booming market, as girls were bought and sold by wealthy Chinese and British men. British rule legalized the sale of human beings and slavery, despite it being illegal in England. </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>Chinese residents were given curfews, and criminal punishments would range from legal physical beatings to bodily mutilation (compared to British rule breakers who would just pay a fine). </p>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>This is only HALF of the paper that is well sourced with primary sources. You can find the paper <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iMH1v4MpPWjgH0WbfggIEqAfGV7mt0lQ/view">here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[17]" title="press . then 17 and Enter to open link"></span> and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2348771">here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[18]" title="press . then 18 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <p><strong>4. So many people are involved with the protests, they can't be all CIA operatives!</strong></p>

      <p><a href="https://i.redd.it/tc1txp3kgee31.png" class="hoverZoomLink">As of 2017, more than 60% of Hong Kong citizens do not support the idea of independence for Hong Kong vs. 11.4% supporting independence.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[19]" title="press . then 19 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button image collapsed" title="" data-host="default"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="default"></div>. Additionally, there is extreme doubt as to whether these crowds are as large as they seem, [with media drastically giving wrong calculations and numbers.]()</p>

      <p>As of now, HK has one of the highest income inequalities in the world, along with a horrid housing crisis, with people sleeping in literal cages. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGFp0zIls2c">On August 6, 2019, The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions; the largest union in Hong Kong with over 410,000 workers and a pro-Beijing orientation, makes a statement vehemently opposing the one-day strike launched by the anti-Beijing Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions.</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[20]" title="press . then 20 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div></p>

      <p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/TheCrypticMan/hong-kong-protests/wiki/2019%20attempted%20'Black%20Revolution'#markdown-header-pro-china-rallies-and-demonstrations">If you want to learn more about the Pro-Beijing Rallies that have been happening in HK (yes, they exist), see here</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[21]" title="press . then 21 and Enter to open link"></span></p>

      <p>If all of this does not convince you that you should at least admit that this is a complex situation where the West should stay out of, then you are part of the problem. </p>

      <p><strong>5. So now you support Police Officers?</strong></p>

      <p>This truly frustrates me because it illustrates the "blind equality" that some leftist give to ALL police without comprehending the systems, cultures, economics, and back stories of such institutions. Police in China are not the same as police in the US, which are deeply rooted in racism, slavery, and mass murder for the sake of private property. In addition, this entire point is irrelevant: whether or not police are there to maintain the peace or not, it does not resolve the tensions between HK protesters and the Chinese government. </p>

      <p>With this said, there are some serious security threats being made against the government, including <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019429/bomb-disposal-squad-called-after-explosive-substance">Hong Kong police bust city’s biggest bomb-making attempt</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[22]" title="press . then 22 and Enter to open link"></span>. Now, yes, this can be considered a rebellion and violence is involved for these reprisals. But again, with the US's fingerprints all over these protests, it is for their benefit. Not the people of HK. They are more than willing to sacrifice lives for the sake of political gain. </p>

      <p>We are obviously not hoping for a massacre to happen (if the media does report on one, I hope all of us will be highly skeptical at first before distancing ourselves from such acts). We do not support a brutal repression, but do point the hypocrisy of crying "repression" on one side, while complaining about protesters on the other (BLM, Colin Kaepernick, Occupy, etc.). As Mao Tse Tung said: "Communist firmly stand for peace and are against war, but if the imperialists insist on war, we shall not be afraid of it."  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gtUaGV6mNI">Michael Parenti explains why every leftist must comprehend "authoritarian measures" taken by socialist governments</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[23]" title="press . then 23 and Enter to open link"></span><span class="res-freetext-expando"><a class="expando-button video collapsed" title="" data-host="youtube"></a></span><div class="res-expando-box" hidden="" data-host="youtube"></div>. But China does not even come close to the measures taken from their counterparts when it comes to the HK situation. </p>

      <p><strong>So with all that said: Chinese comrades, WE SUPPORT YOU.</strong></p>
