    <div class="md">

      <p>Hello, I just came back from an amazing journey in the People's Republic of China, and have visited many cities and places, like Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Tongli, Guilin, etc. etc.</p>

      <p>It was amazing and everything, but while you may be interested in the architectural and natural beauties of this amazing country, this is <a href="/r/communism">r/communism</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1]" title="press 1 to open link"></span>, so I'll write about CPC, SWCC and my knowledge of it based on <em>studies and</em> <strong><em>talks</em></strong> <em>with Chinese people.</em> In the end you'll find some interesting pictures about CPC posters, communist things and everything!</p>

      <p>I want to write my personal analysis of the Constitution of CPC and the whole system called SWCC. This post just shows what they think, I don't want to tell anyone to believe in this or in that, this is just an explanation with some links.</p>

      <p>Before starting: comrades, if you go to Shanghai, go to visit the site of the first CPC congress, it's AMAZING!</p>

      <pre><code>The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation.
</code></pre>

      <p>From the very beginning of the Constitution, we can understand that CPC is based on the theory of Vanguardism, which is a strategy whereby the most class-conscious and politically advanced sections of the working class, described as the revolutionary vanguard, form organizations in order to draw larger sections of the working class towards revolutionary politics and serve as manifestations of proletarian political power against its class enemies.</p>

      <p>The CPC is based on <strong>Democratic centralism</strong>, which is <em>a democratic practice in which political decisions reached by voting processes are binding upon all members of the party.</em> As you know, the whole concept of Democratic centralism can be synthesized in the expression "freedom of discussion, unity of action", written by Lenin on the <strong>Report on the Unity Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.</strong> (Link: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/rucong/viii.htm">https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/rucong/viii.htm</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2]" title="press 2 to open link"></span>).</p>

      <p>The third article of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China (adopted on December 4, 1982) is about Democratic centralism, here's the article:</p>

      <pre><code>The state organs of the People's Republic of China apply the principle of democratic centralism. The National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at different levels are instituted through democratic election. They are responsible to the people and subject to their supervision. All administrative, judicial and procuratorial organs of the state are created by the people's congresses to which they are responsible and under whose supervision they operate. The division of functions and powers between the central and local state organs is guided by the principle of giving full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under the unified leadership of the central authorities.
</code></pre>

      <p>Let's continue with the Constitution of the CPC:</p>

      <pre><code>It is the leadership core for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and represents the developmental demands of China’s advanced productive forces, the orientation for China’s advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the Chinese people.
</code></pre>

      <p>Here we can understand two things:</p>

      <p>​</p>

      <ol>

        <li>The CPC guides the whole nation. That's not new, Mao Zedong already talked about the role of the Party at the <em>Talk at the general reception for the delegates to the Third National Congress of the NewDemocratic Youth League of China</em> (May 25, 1957).</li>

      </ol>

      <p>​</p>

      <p>2) The CPC developed the concept of Communist Party, by creating the <em>"Theory of the Three Represents",</em> developed by Jiang Zemin, the third Chinese president.</p>

      <p>​</p>

      <p>This theory is divided in three parts:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>CPC represents advanced social productive forces.</li>

        <li>CPC represents the progressive course of China's advanced culture.</li>

        <li>CPC represents the fundamental interests of the majority.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>This is the explanation of the first representation:</p>

      <pre><code>The Party's basic nature determines that it must represent the development trend of China's advanced productive forces. Productive forces are the most revolutionary and dynamic factors in social mode of production, and they are the forces that ultimately determine how human society develops. The competition among all the forces in the world today is, in the final analysis, a competition in overall national power, including economic, scientific and technological strength and national cohesiveness. China's productive forces have grown fairly rapidly over the 50 plus years since the People's Republic was founded in 1949, especially over the 20 plus years since the policies of reform and opening up were introduced in the late 1970s. However, their overall level is still much lower than in the developed countries in the West. China must vigorously develop its productive forces and improve its economy so that it can gain greater initiative and a more favorable position in future competition in science and technology and solve its present economic and social problems. All the Party's battles during the 80 plus years since its founding have been waged to emancipate and develop the productive forces. The Party must ground itself on China's realities, conform to the trend of the times, stay focused on economic development, and make developing the productive forces its basic task.
</code></pre>

      <p>This is the explanation of the second representation:</p>

      <pre><code>Socialist society means a society that develops and progresses comprehensively. A society is truly socialist only when its economic, political and cultural development is balanced and a good job is done in both material and spiritual civilization. Only by always representing the orientation of China's advanced culture and working hard to develop a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics can the CPC achieve this goal. In present-day China, developing advanced culture means developing a national, scientific, and popular culture that is geared to the needs of modernization, the world and the future. The fundamental task of socialist culture is to educate citizens to have lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education and a strong sense of discipline. We must always take Marxism as our guide, clearly discern the orientation of advanced culture, and resolutely oppose wrong, anti-Marxist ideas. At the same time, we must clearly understand that Marxism is a developing science. It cannot be regarded as a rigid dogma; new experience and understanding gained from practice must be constantly assimilated and used to enrich and develop Marxism.
</code></pre>

      <p>This is the explanation of the third representation:</p>

      <pre><code>Ever since our Party was founded, its primary aim has been to serve the people wholeheartedly. Over the past 80 plus years, all our successes in both revolution and development have been attributable mainly to the fact that we represent the interests of the overwhelming majority of the people and are able to unite with them in their struggles for their own interests. In the circumstances of carrying out the reform and opening up and expanding the socialist market economy, our Party must emphasize working for the interests of the people more than ever before. The Party's greatest political strength is that we have maintained close ties with the masses, and the greatest danger since assuming political power has lain in the possibility of being estranged from them. Whether the line, principles and policies the Party formulates conform to the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people must be taken as the highest criterion for judging them, and whether the people are satisfied with and agree with them must be taken as their basis and goal. Our cadres must maintain the work style and the way of thinking of "from the masses, to the masses". They must be concerned about the people's hardships, listen to their opinions and protect their interests. Party officials, especially leaders at all levels, must be incorruptible and self-disciplined and share weal and woe with the masses. At all times and under any circumstances, Party officials must follow the Party's mass line, adhere to the objective of serving the people wholeheartedly, and take benefiting the people as the starting and end points of all their work. They must carefully study the new character of mass work in the new situation and integrate strengthening and improving mass work into all their work relating to Party building and consolidating political power. 
</code></pre>

      <p>Let's continue with the analysis:</p>

      <pre><code>The Party’s highest ideal and ultimate goal is the realization of communism.
</code></pre>

      <p>Well, this is self-explanatory. China is, for CPC members, in the <em>first phase of socialism</em>, which is a kind of socialism that needs to develop, in order to arrive to the <em>advanced phase of socialism</em>, and then communism.</p>

      <p>You all know that communism isn't something that can be established, just like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels pointed out in the German Ideology:</p>

      <pre><code>Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established.
</code></pre>

      <p>CPC has many goals: 2021, 2035-2050.</p>

      <p>2021 will be the centenary of the CPC, and by this year the "war against poverty" will have to be completed (interesting article about it: <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-08/29/c_136566153.htm">http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-08/29/c_136566153.htm</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3]" title="press 3 to open link"></span>).</p>

      <p>The second goal is even more ambitious, I'll quote this article (<a href="https://qz.com/1105337/chinas-19th-party-congress-your-five-minute-summary-of-xi-jinpings-three-hour-speech/">https://qz.com/1105337/chinas-19th-party-congress-your-five-minute-summary-of-xi-jinpings-three-hour-speech/</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4]" title="press 4 to open link"></span>) about the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party:</p>

      <pre><code>[...] the second stage will last from 2035-2050, during which China will become a leading global power and the Chinese people will basically enjoy “common property.” By then, Xi said, “the Chinese nation will stand with a more high-spirited image in the family of nations.”
</code></pre>

      <p>The next part of the CPC Constitution is about the body of theories that the Party itself uses as a guide to action:</p>

      <pre><code>The Communist Party of China uses Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng
Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development, and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as its
guides to action.
</code></pre>

      <p>This is what CPC thinks about Marxism-Leninism:</p>

      <pre><code>Marxism-Leninism reveals the laws governing the development of the history of
human society. Its basic tenets are correct and have tremendous vitality.
</code></pre>

      <p>The CPC starts from Marxism-Leninism because: <em>"If there is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary style, it is impossible to lead the working class"</em> (Mao Zedong, “Revolutionary Forces of the World Unite, Fight Against Imperialist Aggression!” (November 1948), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 284.).</p>

      <pre><code>The highest ideal of communism pursued by Chinese Communists can be realized only when socialist
society is fully developed and highly advanced. The development and improvement of the socialist system is a long historical process. By upholding the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism and following the path suited to China’s specific conditions as chosen by the Chinese people, China’s socialist cause will ultimately be victorious.
</code></pre>

      <p>What China is trying to reach is the <em>highest phase of communist society.</em> Karl Marx talks about that in the <strong>Critique of the Gotha Programme</strong>:</p>

      <pre><code>In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly -- only then then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!
</code></pre>

      <p>After Marxism-Leninism, CPC uses as its guide to action the so called "Mao Zedong Thought":</p>

      <pre><code>With Comrade Mao Zedong as their chief representative, Chinese Communists developed Mao Zedong Thought by combining the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism with the actual practice of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China; it is a body of theoretical principles and a summary of experiences, proven correct in practice, relating to China’s revolution and construction; and it is a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in the long revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, securing victory in the new democratic revolution and founding the People’s Republic of China, a people’s democratic dictatorship. After the founding of the People’s Republic, the Communist Party of China successfully led the
people in carrying out socialist transformation, completing the transition from New Democracy to socialism, establishing the basic socialist system, and developing a socialist economy, politics, and culture. 
</code></pre>

      <p>There is a big discussion about CPC and the whole Mao Zedong Thought, there are two POVs in this discussion:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>CPC has completely abandoned MZT.</li>

        <li>CPC has evolved MZT into creating a complex theoretical and practical system.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>I can only talk about my experience in China, since I asked many people about Mao Zedong, MZT, SWCC and CPC.</p>

      <p>These are my experiences:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>The first person I asked about Mao Zedong was a buddhist, and he completely hated Mao Zedong. In his opinion, almost everything has changed after Mao's death, but he wasn't a big fan of the CPC too, especially of the last policies of Xi Jinping, which is the most loved leader of China along with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.</li>

        <li>The second person I asked about Mao Zedong was a complete lover of his country, truly an interesting person. He just knew almost everything about China, about the Empire, the Kuomintang, about Mao Zedong, etc. etc.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>He absolutely knew everything about Mao, read all his works, quoted "On contradiction" and the "Red book" many times, defended the Cultural Revolution, and told me that Mao is almost considered like a god in China, and that he's considered "great for war times, not so great for politics". He asked me "do you want to know who was great for politics? Zhou Enlai". He basically told me that Mao Zedong is still loved by the majority of the population (I've visited a house, and they had a big portrait of Mao Zedong. In Guilin, at night, you can see old people going near the lake and start singing songs of the Mao-era).</p>

      <p>3) The third person was an absolute comrade, loved the guy, he was funny as hell, his screensaver was a Mao Zedong picture, talked positively about Stalin, defended the CPC policies on Tibet, Tienamnen Square and Taiwan (oh, oh, oh, the things he has told me about Taiwan, americans are starting to be more aggressive with China everyday that passes). He talked about CPC, their vision for communism and what they want to accomplish.</p>

      <p>PS: there are many posters and everything about communism and CPC in China, I'll upload some pictures that I've taked, you may find them pretty interesting!).</p>

      <p>​</p>

      <p>We've arrived to the so called "Deng Xiaoping Theory":</p>

      <pre><code>After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China, Chinese Communists, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their chief representative, analyzed both positive and negative experience gained since the founding of the People’s Republic, emancipated the mind, and sought truth from facts. They shifted the focus of the whole Party’s work onto economic development and introduced reform and opening up, thereby ushering in a new era of development in socialism; they gradually formulated the line, principles, and policies for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, brought clarity to basic questions on building, consolidating, and developing socialism in China, and thus established Deng Xiaoping Theory. Deng Xiaoping Theory is the product of combining Marxism-Leninism’s basic tenets with practice in contemporary China and the particular features of the era; it is a continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions; it represents a new stage for the development of Marxism in China; it is the Marxism of contemporary China and a crystallization of the collective
wisdom of the Communist Party of China; and it guides the continuous progression of China’s socialist modernization.
</code></pre>

      <p>One in my group asked to a chinese about private property, and this person answered that while a private property sector exists, <strong>ALL</strong> the important sectors are state-owned and use economic planning. All the lands are state-owned, for example.</p>

      <p>​</p>

      <p>You may want to know about SASAC, I'll give you two links:</p>

      <ol>

        <li><a href="http://en.sasac.gov.cn/">http://en.sasac.gov.cn/</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5]" title="press 5 to open link"></span> -&gt; That's the link of the website in english, it's pretty interesting.</li>

        <li><a href="http://en.sasac.gov.cn/2018/07/17/c_7.htm">http://en.sasac.gov.cn/2018/07/17/c_7.htm</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6]" title="press 6 to open link"></span> -&gt; Here you can find an infographic about what the SASAC does.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>​</p>

      <p>Next part of the Constitution is about Three Represents, but I already talked about that, so let's skip it and let's analyze and talk about the "Scientific Outlook on Development", which is, trust me, one of the most important theories of SWCC:</p>

      <pre><code>On the basis of the new demands of development they forged a deep understanding of and answered major questions, including what kind of development to pursue and how to pursue it in a new situation, thus forming the Scientific Outlook on Development, which puts people first and calls for comprehensive, balanced, and sustainable development. The Scientific Outlook on Development is a scientific theory that continues in congruence with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng
Xiaoping Theory, and the Theory of Three Represents, while advancing with the times. It fully embodies the Marxist worldview and methodology on development and represents a major achievement in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context. It is a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China and a guiding ideology that must be upheld long term in developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</code></pre>

      <p>During Jiang Zemin's years of leadership, with almost incessant growth, new contradictions emerged, the most important being the social inequalities between people and between places. I have visited Shanghai, which is almost futuristic, but I also visited the rural China, and I've seen the inequalities. Scientific Outlook on Development was created to solve this contradiction.</p>

      <p>During my trip in Hangzhou, a Chinese woman told me that Hangzhou was, years ago, the fifth and then fourth city for economic development in China, after Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzen, now it's at the seventh place. Why? During the great growth of Hangzhou, new social inequalities emerged, by using the SOOD they decided to <strong>grow less, but better</strong>. This concept is applied in almost all China, and with this vision many ecological policies have emerged. You'll see the pictures of urban planning in Shanghai.</p>

      <p>We have arrived to "Xi Jinping Thought":</p>

      <pre><code>Since the Party’s 18th National Congress, Chinese Communists, with Comrade Xi Jinping as their chief representative, in response to contemporary developments and by integrating theory with practice, have systematically addressed the major question of our times—what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics the new era requires us to uphold and develop and how we should uphold and develop it, thus giving shape to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The Thought is a continuation and development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng
Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development. It is the latest achievement in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context, a crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the Party and the people, an important component of the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a guide to action for the entire Party and all the Chinese people to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and must be upheld long term and constantly developed. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the Communist Party of China has led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in a concerted effort to carry out a great struggle, develop a great project, advance a great cause, and realize a great dream, ushering in a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</code></pre>

      <p>It's different with Xi Jinping, because he hasn't developed a theory or a vision like Jiang or Jintao, his thought was crystallized in the Constitution, and it's now the new addition to the Party's guide to action. Everyone, and I say everyone, that talked about Xi Jinping had only positive things to say. I've heard people criticizing Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, etc. etc. but with Xi Jinping is different. You really perceive that he has a vision not only for China, but for the entire world too. During my stay in Beijing, there was a meeting with Malesia, I saw many CPC functionaries and saw Xi Jinping everywhere.</p>

      <pre><code>China is currently in the primary stage of socialism and will remain so for a long time to come. This is a stage of history that cannot be bypassed as China, which used to be economically and culturally lagging, makes progress in socialist modernization; it will take over a century. China’s development of socialism must begin from China’s own circumstances and must follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the present stage, the principal contradiction in Chinese society is that between the ever-growing needs of the people for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. Owing to both domestic factors and international influences, a certain amount of class struggle will continue to exist for a long time to come, and under certain circumstances may even grow more pronounced, however, it is no longer the principal contradiction. In building socialism in China, the basic tasks are to further release and develop the productive forces and gradually achieve socialist modernization and, to this end, reform those elements and areas within the relations of production and the superstructure that are unsuited to the development of the productive forces.
</code></pre>

      <p>This sums up everything I've written before: their goals, the contradictions, the stages of socialism.</p>

      <p>This part is about economic control and planning:</p>

      <pre><code>The Party must uphold and improve the basic economic system whereby public ownership plays a dominant role and economic entities under diverse forms of ownership develop side by side. It must maintain and improve the distribution system whereby distribution according to labor is dominant and a variety of other modes of distribution exist alongside it. It must encourage some areas and some people to become well-off first, gradually eliminate poverty, achieve common prosperity, and on the basis of developing production and social wealth, keep meeting the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life and promote people’s well-rounded development.
</code></pre>

      <p>Another concept of CPC is the "Four Cardinal Principles", formulated by Deng Xiaoping:</p>

      <pre><code>The Four Cardinal Principles—to keep to the path of socialism, to uphold the people’s democratic dictatorship, to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and to uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought—form the foundation for building the country. Throughout the whole course of socialist modernization, the Party must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization.
</code></pre>

      <p>As for the so called "socialist market economy", it's important to discuss about the public and private sector: while the public sector is planned by the CPC, the non-public sector still has to follow the needs of the country:</p>

      <pre><code>The Communist Party of China shall lead the people in developing the socialist market economy. It shall be firm in consolidating and developing the public sector of the economy and shall remain steadfast in encouraging, supporting, and guiding the development of the non-public sector.
</code></pre>

      <p>As for socialist democracy, here's what the CPC is doing to create and develop it:</p>

      <pre><code>The Communist Party of China shall lead the people in developing socialist democracy. It shall preserve the organic unity of Party leadership, the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance, follow the Chinese socialist path of political development, expand socialist democracy, develop a socialist rule of law system with Chinese characteristics, and build a socialist rule of law country, thereby consolidating the people’s democratic dictatorship and developing a socialist political civilization. It shall uphold and improve the people’s congress system, the Communist Party-led system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and the system of public self-governance at the primary level.
</code></pre>

      <p>A Chinese person told me about "two lines" in China's politics:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>The first line is communist party.</li>

        <li>The second line are elections of mayors, which can be from other political parties, but they still have to follow the CPC.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>​</p>

      <p>As for the so called advanced culture:</p>

      <pre><code>The Communist Party of China shall lead the people in developing advanced socialist culture. It shall promote socialist cultural-ethical progress, ensure the practice of the rule of law in combination with the rule of virtue, and work to strengthen the thinking and morality as well as the knowledge of science and culture of the whole nation to provide powerful ideological guarantees, motivation, and intellectual support for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and develop a strong socialist culture in China. It shall strengthen the system of core socialist values, uphold Marxism as its guiding ideology.
</code></pre>

      <p>Remember when I talked about the ecological policies of PRC?</p>

      <pre><code>The Communist Party of China shall lead the people in building a socialist ecological civilization. It shall strengthen the philosophy underlying ecological civilization that nature should be respected, adapted to, and protected; fully understand that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets; follow the fundamental national policy of conserving resources and protecting the environment; uphold the principle of prioritizing resource conservation and environmental protection and letting nature restore itself; and take a positive path to development that ensures increased production, higher living standards, and healthy ecosystems.
</code></pre>

      <p>As for political unity of China:</p>

      <pre><code>The Communist Party of China shall urge all workers, farmers, and intellectuals, and all other political parties, persons without party affiliation, and the patriotic forces of all ethnic groups in China to further develop and expand the broadest possible patriotic united front embracing all socialist workers, all those working for the socialist cause, all patriots who support socialism, all patriots who support the reunification of the motherland, and all patriots who are dedicated to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Party shall work continuously to strengthen the unity of all the Chinese people, including compatriots in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and in Taiwan as well as overseas Chinese. It shall promote long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao and achieve the reunification of the motherland in conformity with the principle of “one country, two systems.”
</code></pre>

      <p>In order to achieve the goal of communism, the Party must follow five fundamental requirements:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>Adherence to the Party’s basic line.</li>

        <li>Commitment to emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, advancing with the times, and being realistic and pragmatic.</li>

        <li>Dedication to wholeheartedly serving the people.</li>

        <li>Resolve in upholding democratic centralism.</li>

        <li>Firmness in exercising strict self-supervision and self-governance.</li>

      </ol>
